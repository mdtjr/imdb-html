Finding a love letter from June to Nigel but unaware it was written many years earlier, Terry allows Sir Dennis and Malcolm to ply him with Dutch courage and stalk June, finally gate-crashing a poetry reading meeting which Terry, listening at the door, has interpreted as a declaration of love for June by the vicar.",

After they have discovered that the bell has no clapper the trap door shuts and the handle comes away in Terry's hand, shutting them in the belfry. As a thunderstorm looms it all seems to fit in with June's dream from the night before that they are locked in a towering inferno. Can Terry attract attention by throwing roof slates at a passing police car?",
