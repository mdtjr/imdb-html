Tim makes a stand and purchases a Velazquez self portrait for an outrageous amount then tries to donate to the National gallery. The Minister is shocked; no one ever goes to the National gallery anymore, especially the English. The Goodies then launch a scheme to steal the other paintings from the gallery then claim the insurance money as a way to pay for the Velazquez painting. The scheme backfires when the Minister decides to close the gallery down altogether. They only have one painting, the Velazquez which is far too valuable to exhibit. News comes through announcing the Galley will reopen, but needs paintings. Graeme realizes the problem is the National Gallery needs to become more interesting. He sets about using the paintings as centerpieces for side show stalls. The scheme works so well the Minister dismisses the boys, leaving them penniless and still owing money on the original painting. In the end Tim fives up and offers to auction everything to cashed up Americans, effectively leaving everything exactly where it was before the Goodies got involved",

The Goodies agree till she offers to pay them. The boys are inept at dancing till Graeme supplies specially designed suits that will do the dancing for the boys. Moments before the dance competition, Delia Capone visits the boys and tries to bribe them. They refuse, and she warns they better get insurance. The suits work perfectly and the boys stay competitive in the competition. During a break Delia discovers the Goodies secret and sabotages their efforts. However the judges still declares them winners. During the celebrations Capone pays a visit and reveals Fay's true identity, Peaches Ferneto, famous ballroom shark who'd served 5 years for throwing a dance competition. Peaches admits to everything. The two agree to a dance off winner takes all. At dawn the two teams face off and the Goodies prevail.",

Disgusted they've had enough and go to a local restaurant, only to discover that none of their food is prepared by cooks by Nobel prize winning chemists. Desperate for a decent meal they got to visit Tim's uncle who is a farmer. Surprised they discover he's also gone high tech and the entire process is now automated. His uncle has taken things to such extremes that hens lay square eggs to make for easier shipping, and headless cows, because no one can eat the head. Graeme believes the food being produced lacks nutrition and invents a machine to prove his point. The tests confirm his theory, but Graeme realizes they need to close down the buyers. First he sabotages Uncle Tom's processes and the restaurant purchasing the food suffers a huge loss of clientèle. Mission accomplished they return to the farm and a free range chicken to eat for dinner. Tom comes in at the last minute, totally reformed and now a vegetarian and forbids the now starving Goodies from eating his animals",

He calls the Women's Liberation army, and Barbara comes to Goodies HQ and threatens to rough the boys up. She then sends them to her father's home to work as domestics so they can get an insight into the life of a woman. After a few days of Tim (dressed as a woman) and Graeme working at the house, Barbara arrives to announce that Bill is her new boyfriend. Tim struggles to adapt back to being a man after the encounter, and is convinced he is a liberated woman. Graeme now totally confused over how to handle gender relationships takes his computer out on a date. Finally Tim is forced to leave HQ after Bill and Graeme announce a double wedding to their respective partners. At the Church Tim makes an impassioned speech that convinces everyone to call the weddings off. He unfortunately attracts the attention of Barbara's father who thinks he might make a good brood mare, and all three boys make good their escape on their bike",

She objects to the use of the word gender in the opening sequence and threatens to sue the boys. She quickly convinces the world the Goodies are smut mongers and can't be trusted. They see a chance of redemption when a TV show featuring Reginald Wheelbarrow discusses the film. The Goodies kidnap the Member of Parliament and appear in his place, talking how tame the film is. The BBC realizes the ruse but then commission the boys to make more films. It is explained that the controversy around gender education is a way to keep people occupied with nonsense while the put the most violent shows they can think of. Graeme and Tim are disgusted by the idea, but Bill embraces the concept as a way to make lots of money. Eventually Desiree Tim and Graeme join forces to stop him by sabotaging the studios where Bill is making his productions. Bill goes crazy at the interference and tries to kill the other Goodies with a machine gun. He continues on in his rampage till he accidentally blows up the BBC destroying all TV broadcast in the British Isles",

The house is completed and the boys move in. Soon their quiet paradise is built up with housing developments and trains.

Outside they hear strange noises, investigating they discover the building surrounding by earth moving equipment that have a life of their own.

    "description": "The Goodies fall on hard times, and Tim and Graeme send Bill to sell their trusty three-seater trandem. All the local townspeople find it ridiculous and Bill is humiliated by only being offered a tin of baked beans. Tim and Graeme are disgusted with only getting baked beans, instead of money, but Graeme gets the idea to plant a bean. This rapidly grows into an enormous beanstalk - reaching all the way from England to the summit of Mt. Everest. In hot pursuit of their beanstalk, the Goodies enter an \"It's a Knockout\" competition, which is being held at the foot of Mt. Everest. Among other things, the Goodies have to climb the beanstalk to the top of the mountain, as part of the contest. There, they find the Giant's castle and, in it, a Giant of surprising height who has a valuable secret to protect.",
