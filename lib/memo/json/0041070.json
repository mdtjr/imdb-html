    "description": "A man and a woman escape to a seedy hotel after robbing a bank and killing a watchman. They are led to their room by a strange-acting bellhop and discover that they've been locked in without food, water, weapons or even their loot. The bellhop seems to be the master of the situation - but is he a real person, a supernatural being or the personification of the couple's collective conscience?",
