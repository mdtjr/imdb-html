    "description": "Plausible fraudster Howard Booth is released from a two year prison sentence and,feigning a limp, calls on gullible sister Mary,who is married to estate agent Trevor Mountjoy. Mary is keen for Howard to stay but Trevor will only consent - and then reluctantly - if Howard pretends he has spent the last two years in Zimbabwe. Howard falls for Laura,a widow from next door,but dares not tell her that he is responsible for her losing her savings. He does however suddenly get the full use of his leg back,apparently through acupuncture.",
