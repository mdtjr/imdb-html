    "description": "Less than happily married to Yvonne, television repair man Gary Sparrow walks down Duckett's passage in London's East End and winds up in the Royal Oak, which he thinks is a war-time theme pub. In fact he has gone back in time to 1940. Initially mistaken for a spy, he cheers the customers during an air-raid by singing 1970s pop songs which he says he has written and saves the landlord's life by giving him the kiss of life, which he claims to have learned in America. He is attracted to the landlord's daughter Phoebe, but she is married to a serving soldier.",

Jayne Mansfield, the estate agent who helped him get the shop, tries to seduce him and when he resists, tells Yvonne he made a pass at her. However he convinces Yvonne this is not true and Yvonne pours coffee in her computer. Whilst actually going on a skiing holiday with Yvonne, Gary tells the Royal Oak regulars that he has to go to Singapore, at which point it is announced that America has entered the war.",

Back in 1942 he places an advert in the Times saying he would like to buy Swiss watches. He tells Reg these are to drop behind enemy lines telling different times to confuse Hitler but they are to sell in his shop. A little man turns up with a case-load, followed by undercover cop Tommy Kingdom, whose cover Reg blows. The man escapes, having apparently picked Gary's pocket of the one watch he managed to buy but fortunately Phoebe got there first and hid it in the Wonderbra Gary bought her.",

However, when Gary arrives he is not allowed in because everyone assumes her real husband is her business partner Clive Lezouche. He returns to Phoebe, saying he has been denied access to a party given by Winston Churchill. Phoebe has been denied service by the local butcher for not being posh enough so Noel Coward helps her out with elocution lessons before Gary, posing as a health inspector following up supposed inquiries into bad meat, steals the butcher's stock of venison.",

To ease his sleep Ron slips him a sleeping pill but this gives him a nightmare in which Yvonne and Phoebe have found out about each other and force him to choose between them. He wakes up in a cold sweat in the dark and thinks he is in limbo but it's only a power cut. On Ron's advice he goes for a holiday in Eastbourne.",

The meeting puts him in mind of how in 1944 he provided biscuits for Margie's birthday party at the Royal Oak, where Noel Coward came to entertain. Of course, as ever, this clashes with a present day engagement. Yvonne has written a successful autobiography and wants Gary by her side for the signings. When the porter at Gary's flat block tells him that, in 1944, the occupant of number 15 was run over by a bus, Gary goes back to warn him only to find that the porter got it wrong - the victim was Mr. Foster from number 16. However Gary juggles the two engagements successfully and back in the present Yvonne, who had earlier caught Ron giving Gary a fraternal hug which they had explained as being a lecture on wrestling, decides she would like to wrestle with her husband.",

Real Gary and evil Gary return to the shop where Ron overpowers the bad guy. Then the good and rather camp Gary, who has freed himself and been doing ambulance work for the past three days, appears. At Ron's suggestion all three Garys hold hands and return through the portal, restoring order.",

    "description": "Noel Coward and David Lean are filming 'Brief Encounter' and Noel wants a night club scene with Gary accompanying Phoebe on the piano. However Gary does not want filmed evidence of his time travel and instead Noel employs composer Anthony Blair. Gary is jealous when Phoebe and Anthony appear to be intimate on set but they are just acting in the film. Ultimately Phoebe is cut from the film as its star Celia Johnson does not think her character would go to night clubs. In the present Gary has his own Brief Encounter scenario. Yvonne's firm is subject to a hostile takeover by an American firm, thanks to double dealing partner Clive. Yvonne decides to head for the States but, at the station, Gary in pursuit of her, trips over a porter's trolley and breaks his arm. Yvonne stays as Gary, over the phone, forces Clive to recompense her.",

Gary is to provide entertainment at the Royal Oak but only Marie Lloyd - who looks like Yvonne - finds him entertaining. There is a serial killer on the loose, none other than Jack the Ripper, and when Gary gets back to his shop he finds that Jack the Ripper, also a time traveller, has followed him through the portal. He reluctantly lets Jack go, only for Jack to get run over and killed. This is presumably why the Whitechapel murders ended when they did.",

Sparks has told Gary the portal will take four hours to close but, come the deadline, it is still open and he comes back to the empty shop to discover that the anomaly that was closed was the gateway to 2168, through which Brick Beckham has passed with all the stock - for which he had yet to pay.",

    "description": "Yvonne is reading an biography of Noel Coward which contains a photo, taken by Cecil Beaton, of a party Noel gave at the Sparrows' night club, in which Gary figures. When Gary's efforts to stop the photo being taken fail he raids Beaton's studio and destroys the negative but is arrested. Noel and Reg both come to bail him out and accidentally feature in the mug shot the zealous young copper is taking of Gary, rather than Gary himself. This photo now replaces the one of Gary in the book but, whilst Ron accidentally books himself into a holiday with amorous old ladies, Yvonne goes to see Noel's recently discovered play, 'Gary and Phoebe'.",

    "description": "Yvonne finds a photo of Gary with Phoebe. He claims that it is of his grandfather but she is suspicious and follows him, seeing him vanish into thin air as he goes down the passage. Ron explains to her what has been happening and Gary attempts to tell Reg but he's too drunk after celebrating V.E. Day. Gary saves future prime minister Clement Attlee from being assassinated and thinks that maybe this is why he was sent back in time. He tries to get back to 1999 but the portal has closed for good and he and Yvonne say their goodbyes on either side as Gary prepares to start post-war life with Phoebe, and Ron, whilst decorating Gary's old flat in the present, comes across a message from Gary written forty-four years earlier.",
