    "description": "Shy librarian Alison Little arrives at a hotel to meet long-lost cousin Tom Cheyney. Eccentric,accident-prone Tom Chance turns up for a blind date with Alison Hughes but due to a misunderstanding they end up with each other as Tom's clumsiness with a rowing oar knocks his date and a rude male receptionist unconscious. Tom is later arrested after trying to help a woman who has locked her lover's keys in his car and he tells Alison he is no stranger to being arrested for things he has not done. Thus,after a slapstick fight with a depressed waiter in a restaurant which necessitates a change of clothes Tom is apprehended breaking into his house having left his door keys back at the restaurant in his coat pocket.",

Alison's parents arrive at Tom's house but her mother gets caught up with a group of girls who are changing into nightwear to break a record of how many people can fit in a phone box and,when she escapes,is chased by a dog.

Eventually Tom leads Alison to her party but all the guests are total strangers as Tom mistook her Lost Property customers book for her address book. The irate woman in search of her fur coat also arrives whilst her boyfriend accidentally runs over the singing pillar box.

Alison and Tom go to look at a vacant flat recommended by Corporal Browning but find it is being taken by Roger and his mistress,though Tom manages to split them up as well. Returning to Tom's house they find that yet another misunderstanding has caused the building to be fumigated by pest control and they end up sleeping in the boat,which,with Corporal Browning's army band serenading them,they find very romantic.",

    "description": "A young Portuguese couple,the wife heavily pregnant,arrive at Tom's. They have come for hotel work but are in the wrong town. Fortunately Alison can speak their language and she and Tom agree they should stay with them. Tom is summoned by a tax inspector who,wondering why he has no income but appears well off,gives the option of paying the bill or marrying Barbara,his daughter - whom he wrongly believes to be Barbara's boyfriend. Alison gets Barbara to bring her real fiancé to the house,ahead of the Portuguese couple's uncle Mateo,who is so pleased with Tom for looking after the youngsters that he showers him with expensive presents. The downside here is that the tax man now believes Tom really does lead an expensive life-style.",

She dresses as a tart for a vicars and tarts party and gets arrested for soliciting when she goes into an off-licence. Tom is dressed as a vicar but then a thief who disguises himself as a vicar is in town with a bunch of genuine clergymen and of course,due to his customary mistaken identity,Tom ends up in the cell next to Alison. Fortunately Sergeant Gough realizes what has happened and releases them along with a vicar to ensure that the couple actually get round to tying the knot.",
