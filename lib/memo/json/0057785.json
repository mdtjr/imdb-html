But Harold warms to the idea of being a father and Albert becomes proud for his son. Unfortunately it turns out that Harold is not the father after all, another party-goer called George is, and he asks Harold to be best man at his wedding to Daphne. Albert does his best to comfort his disappointed son.",

Then her husband arrives, accusing Harold of taking advantage of his wife's ignorance and offering to buy it back for a hundred and fifty quid - which Harold accepts. After he has gone, an antique dealer arrives and goes into raptures over the commode, offering six hundred. However Harold has to buy it back from the irate spouse at three hundred. Albert points out to him that husband and dealer are two con-men working in tandem and Harold has been well and truly had.",

    "description": "Harold wants to go to Switzerland for Christmas whilst Albert, as usual, prefers Bognor, though he is persuaded to go provided they sail, rather than fly. However he has no passport and when Harold finds his birth-certificate in order to get him one, it turns out that Albert is the illegitimate son of the muffin man and the picture of his supposed father is really Gladstone. At customs Albert's new passport is accepted but Harold's is a year out of date, so Albert happily goes on the holiday alone, unaware that Harold has actually cooked a scheme allowing him to spend Christmas with his girl-friend - in Bognor.",
