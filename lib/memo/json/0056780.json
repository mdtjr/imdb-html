They change their plans when they learn that the next day, the Cannonball, without any armed guards, will make its express run from Hooterville to Pixley for the bank shipment. Arthur and Lowell decide to stay the night at the Shady Rest and stop the train the next day by placing a barricade on the tracks so that they can hold it up. Kate and the family are happy to have who they see as two polite and handsome young men stay with them. However, when Arthur and Lowell do hold up the train the next day, they are unprepared for Kate and Uncle Joe also being on the train, they who recognize the masked bandits. In combination with news from Floyd and learning what is in the bank shipment, Arthur and Lowell decide to make what they consider a more lucrative robbery at the Shady Rest instead. But will the down home attitude of Kate, her family and Charley and Floyd be able to turn around Arthur and Lowell's criminal lives?",

    "description": "The Cannonball and its primary passenger, Uncle Joe, are pelted with eggs after the Hooterville Hornets, coached by Uncle Joe, are drubbed in what may be their worst game ever. Another unexpected passenger on that run is Homer Bedloe, who, despite being hit with a couple of eggs himself, is surprisingly cordial and pleasant. While Uncle Joe doesn't see anything wrong with Bedloe being cordial and taking it like a man in defeat in his efforts to scrap the Cannonball - which probably included being humiliated back at head office for his failures - Kate on the other hand believes Bedloe is up to no good. She's right. News gets to Sam that two bigwigs from the railroad, on Bedloe's urging, are coming for a surprise inspection the following day, which is why Bedloe seems so lackadaisical about Charley and Floyd running behind schedule or the coach being stained with dried, rotten eggs. When Kate learns this news, she and the gang have several tasks ahead of them. First, they have to go into operation clean-up Cannonball mode, which will take them through the night. Second, they have to keep Bedloe preoccupied so that he won't know what they're up to. They hope he is lulled into the false sense that he's finally achieved his goal of scraping the Cannonball. And third, they have to railroad the visiting railroaders about how deluxe the service on the Cannonball is.",

    "description": "When Kate and the girls go into town to pick up the pocket watch they ordered through Drucker's store - the watch being Uncle Joe's birthday present - Kate, in an effort to boost Herby's confidence, he who is working for Sam, inadvertently offers him a job as Assistant Manager at the hotel, with an imminent promotion to Manager. Herby readily accepts. Kate doesn't have the heart not to give him the job, so she decides that she can give him some menial tasks at the hotel under the guise of the important sounding position. However, Uncle Joe believes that Herby's arrival and Kate not wanting him to go into town with her and the girls among other things means that Herby is his professional replacement at the hotel and Kate is setting him out to pasture against his will. Wanting to feel useful while doing something important, Uncle Joe goes in search of a job. He gets one, telling everyone that he is an executive with some large company. Knowing that he's probably earning money in some low level job, Kate comes up with a scheme that will make Uncle Joe's wish to be an executive come true. However, that scheme backfires, which sets in motion a deal between Kate and Sam to bring life in the valley for both Uncle Joe and Herby back into equilibrium.",

The special wedding/honeymoon package would include among other things Uncle Joe actually officiating the wedding ceremony. The existing Justice of the Peace just resigned and with two months until the next election, Uncle Joe plans on getting Sam, the county judge, to appoint him JP pro tempore until the election. Uncle Joe figures that by the time the election rolls around, his experience will sweep him to an election win. Kate and the girls can't argue with the idea, except that it was conceived and will be executed by Uncle Joe, whose plans always go awry. Uncle Joe manages to catch Sam to swear him in just before Sam leaves on a one week hunting vacation at Lost Lake. All Uncle Joe has to do is file the documentation at the courthouse to make it legal. After Uncle Joe performs his first wedding, for a young couple named Walter Shepherd and Elsie Gregg, Uncle Joe realizes that he forgot to file the documentation at the courthouse. Uncle Joe doesn't want to admit that he made a mistake to Walter and Elsie, and with it being Friday night and three days until the courthouse opens again, Uncle Joe and the gang try whatever they can either to maneuver Walter and Elsie up to Lost Lake or to find Sam themselves and bring him to the hotel so that he can perform another wedding ceremony before Walter and Elsie consummate what they believe is their marriage. Actually finding Sam is a whole different problem.",

William's last wish was for Billie Jo to use the money to go to medical school. Kate expects Billie Jo to fulfill that last wish. But Billie Jo has a trip to Hollywood and acting stardom on her mind with that $500 instead. Kate thinks that Hooterville's long time doctor, Dr. Depew, can talk Billie Jo into it. But Kate's thinks that Dr. Depew's handsome new assistant, Dr. Clayton Harris, would be able to convince Billie Jo even more. Kate needs to use a little deceit as she knows Billie Jo won't stick around if she knows a doctor wants to talk her into becoming a doctor, and Dr. Harris wouldn't come if he knew that Billie Jo really had no interest in becoming a doctor at all. So using Uncle Joe as a patient with non-existing symptoms, Kate hopes to have Dr. Harris make a thorough examination with Billie Jo as his assistant, exposing her to the wonders of modern medicine. Will Kate's ploy work, or will either Dr. Harris and/or Billie Jo see through her scheme?",

Since Dr. Harris, Dr. Depew's handsome young assistant, couldn't convince Billie Jo to become a doctor, Kate believes that Dr. Depew himself might be able to. Dr. Depew believes Kate's mistake between Dr. Harris and Billie Jo was throwing them together in a doctor/potential doctor relationship, whereas throwing them into a boy/girl relationship starting as doctor/patient might do the trick. First, Kate and her accomplices have to convince Billie Jo that she's not looking well, then get Dr. Harris to come to the continual assistance of his helpless but beautiful patient. Kate believes there is one more piece to complete the puzzle, courtesy of a mock edition of the Hooterville World Guardian.",

    "description": "Uncle Joe has made a deal with Lucy Wayne, the secretary of suave movie star Lane Haggard, for them to stay for two weeks at the Shady Rest. Incognito as Mr. Jones, Haggard, according to Miss Wayne, needs to get some rest and relaxation away from prying public eyes. But upon their arrival, Miss Wayne believes Uncle Joe has duped her. First, Uncle Joe has told what seems like the entire valley about their stay. And second, Miss Wayne wanted no attractive women around to fall under Haggard's reflex movie idol charms, with Kate and the girls what she considers not quite homely as Uncle Joe described them. The problem arises that those reflex charms do surface without Haggard realizing what he is doing, and the three girls, not used to such words from a big city man, believe what he tells each of them instead of those words being niceties which he says to every attractive female. While Kate tries to protect her girls, she also tries to help the one person to who those charms really do mean something, but who can't quite get him to the altar.",

Because of the continual problems he has faced trying to scrap the Cannonball, Bedloe states he has given up on that idea. Instead, he plans on selling the Cannonball - a seemingly one-of-a-kind antique locomotive - and he has a buyer on hand. He is millionaire retired train man and antique train aficionado, Phillip Waterhouse. Waterhouse, who comes with his personal secretary Cassidy, is an old, ornery and snobbish man who generally gets what he wants. Bedloe plans on giving Waterhouse a test run on the train. Instead, Kate manages to be Waterhouse's fellow passenger, leaving Bedloe behind in Hooterville. With Charley and Floyd's help, Kate hopes she can convince Waterhouse that the train is in such disrepair that it's not worth buying. But by the time they arrive at the Shady Rest, Kate learns Waterhouse's true motivation in wanting to buy the train, which was not as she expected. She hopes that with the family's help, she can get through to Waterhouse the necessity of the train to the valley, which may not be an easy task seeing that Waterhouse is not the type of man to listen to anyone's opinion except his own.",

Kate thinks the advice Sam is doling out is all wrong and comes up with better advice to the letter writers. Kate's advice is exactly what Sam was hoping as he wanted a woman to take over the column. He convinces Kate to be Minerva, she agreeing only on the condition that no one knows it's her. The plan is for Kate to type the columns at the hotel, with Dog being the messenger between Sam and Kate. Kate has a difficult time trying to find a place in the hotel where she can type her columns without anyone finding out. She manages to get the job done and the column becomes a big hit, but typing the columns in peace while still attending to her hotel duties and the needs of the family takes its toll on her. Kate finds out in a roundabout way what effect her column writing is having on life at the hotel, and she has to decide if the grief is worth the big time proposal she receives.",

When Uncle Joe learns that Mr. Douglas is a lawyer, Joe hopes to get some free legal advice about how to get out of jury duty. Despite Mr. Douglas stating that he would never give advice on how to get out of what he considers the privilege of serving on a jury, he does unwittingly give Joe an idea. The only thing Joe has to do is find someone else willing to take his place, and he knows the person: Kate. While Kate is away in Pixley serving on the jury, Joe learns that he won the raffle, the prize being a television set which he has to claim by noon tomorrow. Two problems arise. The first is that he can't remember where he put his raffle ticket. When he does remember where he hid the ticket, the second problem becomes how to retrieve it from the suitcase that Kate took with her to Pixley. Joe either has to hope that it is a short trial or that he can get a message to Kate while the jury is sequestered.",

Because of casting problems for the female lead, Betty Jo comes up with a new idea: rewrite the play for an all canine cast with Dog in the lead. Meanwhile, a former guest of the hotel, Mr. Kroger, who has just passed away, has deeded $200 to his favorite resident at the Shady Rest: Dog. With his new found wealth, Dog is generous to his friends, which does not include Uncle Joe, who does whatever he can to get a hold of some of Dog's money. But Dog is also letting the money, the resulting fame and adulation - including a front page newspaper article at which he can't stop staring - and the starring role in the play go to his head. Dog learns the hard way that fame and wealth can be fleeting, and that keeping to commitments is more important.",

    "description": "Kate wants to support Bobbie Jo in the upcoming spelling bee in any way she can, but it may be a losing battle against stuck up but admittedly excellent speller Henrietta Watson. Regardless, Cora Watson, Henrietta's equally stuck up mother, protests Sam's new appointment as judge since she feels he will be biased in favor of Bobbie Jo, the daughter of his best friend. As such, Mr. Douglas, newly arrived in the valley, is appointed the new judge. Whoever the judge, Bobbie Jo doesn't seem to have a chance of winning as she doesn't have the confidence to win, that is until she finds a scarab ring, which coincides with her getting flooded with good luck. Slowly, all the Bradleys and Uncle Joe begin to believe in the power of the ring when they too receive what they want when wearing it. Bobbie Jo feels she can't lose the spelling bee with the ring on her side. She learns the true power of the ring after the spelling bee's conclusion.",

Although Joe knows nothing about construction work, he plans on hiring subcontractors for their expertise while he garners all the profits. He does get Mrs. Douglas to hire him, which starts his juggling act. He plays the hotel and the Douglas jobs against each other. He also finds that he may be scheming rich, but cash poor which means that he needs to find some additional capital to get both jobs going. Uncle Joe's scheming affects Kate in unexpected ways, so she comes up with a plan to set Uncle Joe straight.",

Bobbie Jo thinks that Billie Jo and her seductive powers may be able to help, but Bobbie Jo asked the wrong sister as Stonewall is probably more interested in what Betty Jo can teach her. The Betty Jo School of Sports only has three days of operation before Bobbie Jo needs to get that date. Bobbie Jo thinks that she also has a way to get back at Henrietta for the difficult initiation task.",

Kate not only thinks it's not the best idea for the family, but not the best idea for Dr. Bailey since there just aren't the patients in the valley, especially with everyone in Hooterville going to see Doc Stuart. But once the girls get a look at the young and handsome Dr. Bailey, there is no way they're going to let Kate let him get away. So the Bradley clan opens up an office for Dr. Bailey adjacent to the hotel lobby. But Kate is right: there is no business for Dr. Bailey, who many of the traditionalists in the valley see as too young and inexperienced. The girls and Uncle Joe even go on a marketing spree to round up patients, to no avail. Doc Stuart, who is welcoming of his medical colleague to the valley, unwittingly gives Kate an idea to boost Doc Bailey's clientèle, the plan worthy of the scheming mind of Uncle Joe. Kate's plan takes an unexpected turn.",

    "description": "The Every Other Wednesday Afternoon Discussion Club, with its new member Lisa Douglas, is planning on holding a square dance (which beat out a gay 90's party) as a high school benefit. The kids don't think it's a good idea as a square dance is, well, square. They'd much prefer a dance with music by someone like King Ring a Ding, the biggest recording star in their musical world. Kate won't hear of it as she doesn't consider King Ring a Ding's music as being music. Regardless, the Bradley girls decide to try and get King Ring a Ding to perform at a benefit. Who shows up unexpectedly at the hotel instead is Herbie Willis, who used to live in Hooterville and who Kate encouraged to become a singer as she loved his lyrical voice and soothing rendition of traditional folk songs. Kate wants Herbie to sing at the benefit. What Kate and girls don't realize is that both Herbie and King Ring a Ding can't perform at the benefit together because... When Herbie hears that no tickets have been sold mainly because he's the \"headliner\", Herbie makes a decision for the betterment of Hooterville High. Uncle Joe tries to thwart Herbie's plans, not realizing what his plans actually are, and in the process unknowingly ruin the benefit.",

Uncle Joe is trying to find someone to who he can act as trainer, with Joe retaining the majority of the prize money as a training fee. He thinks he's found that person in Herman Crawley, the strong as an ox but none too bright plumber Kate hires to fix the plumbing problems Uncle Joe caused around the hotel. What makes Herman the perfect candidate in Joe's mind is that he can take punches to the head without even feeling them. Joe does set-up a makeshift boxing ring at the hotel to train Herman, which doesn't sit too well with Kate in so many different ways. When Joe meets Kid Dynamite and his overprotective but brazen manager mother Mrs. Hogan, Joe thinks there's no way Herman can lose. So Joe makes a $500 versus the hotel side wager with Mrs. Hogan on the outcome. What Uncle Joe doesn't realize is that Herman has a particular weakness. In turn, Uncle Joe both has to protect Herman's weakness and find out and exploit the Kid's weakness.",

After an initial hesitation, Kate allows Betty Jo to go. Despite the trip only being a week, Betty Jo and the family have a tearful bon voyage. When Betty Jo returns to Hooterville, she's a changed person, putting on airs and believing country life, especially her chores and even her tomboyish ways, is beneath her. Kate initially believes Mrs. Douglas is to blame for Betty Jo's new snooty attitude, but quickly comes to the realization that she isn't. Kate does get some help from Mrs. Douglas for an upcoming visit by Gregory Tremayne, a young gentleman Betty Jo met in New York. Gregory's visit ultimately shows Betty Jo where her heart lies.",

    "description": "Kate's sixth sense tells her that there is impending doom. Reality ends up being worse: Homer Bedloe shows up. But he tells a story of woe: he has been fired by Norman Curtis for his actions against the Cannonball, and he has been replaced by Wilbur Goodfellow, who is the exact opposite of Bedloe in every way. So Bedloe, penniless, is looking for somewhere, anywhere, that he can call home, at least for a little while. He is even willing to work at the hotel to pay his way. Following Bedloe's arrival is that of said Wilbur Goodfellow, who has come to inspect the spur line and the Cannonball. After his inspection, Goodfellow plans on making major investments into the line as he sees it as an integral part of a burgeoning community. He even plans on sending the Cannonball in for a refit and loaning a new diesel locomotive in its place during that time. Everyone seems to be excited by all this news, except for Kate, who changes her mind about the proposed upgrades and Mr. Goodfellow after she goes to the cinema in Pixley.",

Kate seems nonplussed by the news, but Uncle Joe thinks Kate is acting just a little too nonchalantly, which means she is masking still deep seated romantic feelings for him. Regardless of if she or Ralph has a romantic interest in the other, they probably won't be able to act on them with Ralph's overbearing and busybody spinster sister, Mabel Denton, along for the visit. The girls and Uncle Joe do whatever they can to preoccupy Mabel so that Ralph and Kate can have some romantic alone time together. Joe's scheming has an unintended consequence which he has to figure how to get out of.",

Against Kate's wishes, Joe decides to set up the post office at the hotel's reception desk. Joe tells Kate that the post office will bring customers into the hotel, they who will want to stay for the night. Kate does whatever she can to persuade Joe to give the post office back to Sam and for Sam to take it back. Joe in turn does whatever he can to gather whatever equipment he needs to run the post office, namely to steal whatever he needs all in the name of the federal government. On the customer side, they treat the new post office much like it was still in Drucker's Store. Joe even tries to co-opt Charley and Floyd to help him. When things start falling apart around him, Joe tries one last scheme to deliver the mail as easily for himself as possible.",

So Kate is surprised when a Mr. Reynolds checks in, he who walked to the hotel from Stuben's Bluff instead of taking the train. To Kate and the girls, Mr. Reynolds seems like a warm, friendly and kind man. Despite paying in cash and reserving the entire hotel solely for himself so as not to be disturbed, Uncle Joe however doesn't trust him - how can he trust anyone who likes to walk? Uncle Joe thinks he's a criminal on the run from the law. So when Uncle Joe hears that the Benton Bank was recently robbed of $3,000, Uncle Joe is certain Reynolds is the robber. Uncle Joe does whatever he can to bring Reynolds in to the authorities, more for the $500 reward money than to see justice served. Will Uncle Joe get his man, and if so how will he get Reynolds to the police?",

    "description": "Bobbie Jo and Betty Jo are creating havoc for Kate in the kitchen by entering contests as they are required to send in food can and box top labels, leaving much of Kate's pantry left with unlabeled cans and boxes. Bobbie Jo manages to win one of those contests, with first prize being a traditional English butler for one month. Unannounced, their new butler, Faversham, arrives on their doorstep. As hard as Kate tries, she just can't get accustomed either to relinquishing control of the chores around the hotel or to doing things the traditional English way. The latter is taken to an extra extreme by Uncle Joe, who organizes a fox hunt. The problem for Uncle Joe becomes how first to find a fox, which have been scarce in their parts of late.",

    "description": "Secretarial student Billie Jo wants some real work experience, so Uncle Joe advertises to hotel guests Billie Jo's services as a stenographer. The one hotel guest who does hire Billie Jo is Mr. Norton, a salesman who wants to write a business letter to Frank Mortimer, one of his customers. Norton dictates a letter to Billie Jo that is harsh and scathing as Mortimer reneged on an order worth $15,000, which has placed Norton in a bad position at his company. But Norton decides not to send the letter until he returns to the office as he feels the letter does not yet have a nasty enough tone. It's lucky he decided to do so as he learns when he returns to the office that Mortimer has come through with his large order with a promise for a future order in addition. Norton obviously decides not to send the letter anymore. However, Norton can't find the letter. Norton returns to the Shady Rest to see if he left the letter there. Once back at the Shady Rest, all learn that Uncle Joe found the letter to give to Dog to give to Floyd to give to Sam at the post office for posting. As Kate and the girls try to track down the letter, they all learn that the letter has further taken a trip to the main post office in Pixley. To get the letter back, Kate has to battle a bureaucratic and unorganized Sam (the Hooterville post master), an absent minded Floyd who forgot to stoke the fire of the Cannonball engine, the Pixley postmaster Foley who is easily sidetracked in his thoughts, and locksmith Tad Fiskee who would rather watch a movie at the local theater than unlock the door of the Pixley post office. At the end of the line, Kate still isn't certain if the letter is still there and whether she can get it back. But a good hearted Floyd may ultimately come to the rescue.",

They are the fifth set of friends of Billie Jo's that have gotten married in quick succession. Both Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo are excited by the notion of weddings and marriage, but Betty Jo just sees the festivities as outside of her mentality. So she's horrified when she catches Gladys' bouquet as she feels feels it is a death sentence to have to get married since every person she knows who has caught a bouquet has gotten married shortly thereafter. Since marriage becomes foremost on Betty Jo's mind - despite being only sixteen - Kate decides it's time to have the talk with her about the issue. Betty Jo misinterprets her mother's advice, but it may be a moot point as Betty Jo has a secret admirer who has been sending her gifts. Could a wedding be in the works for Betty Jo and whoever her secret admirer despite Betty Jo not really knowing what true love is?",

She feels that she's outgrown living with her younger sisters, that the traveling back and forth to and from secretarial school in Pixley is more time than it's worth, and that all the eligible young men of the valley live in Pixley. Kate's response?: no. Billie Jo's sisters are on her side, the three who try to come up with ways to convince their mother. Kate finally gives in on the stipulation that she have approval of the place, and by association the landlord. Kate only agreed however as she believes there is not an apartment to be had in all of Pixley. She's wrong as Billie Jo finds a place that does meet Kate's standards, so Kate feels she can't renege. After a few days, Billie Jo states that she loves the feeling of independence, sometimes not realizing what the cost of independence is. And Kate, as much as she openly supports Billie Jo while trying to undermine Billie Jo's efforts, hates to admit that Billie Jo seems to be making a go of it. Is the surface appearance what Kate and Billie Jo are actually feeling and experiencing?",

    "description": "Betty Jo is on the verge of breaking up with her latest beau, Edward, due to differences in their interests - Edward's being more along the intellectual line - leading to differences in their outlooks. He believes Betty Jo is intellectually immature. The problem for Betty Jo is that she now has no date for Saturday night's basketball game. Betty Jo changes her mind about Edward's outlook - but not Edward himself - when she meets an older college boy named Chuck, who is visiting relatives in Hooterville. Chuck believes Betty Jo is an intellectual Emily Dickinson College girl, a misconception she doesn't correct. In an effort to impress Chuck on their upcoming date, Betty Jo tries to be what she believes a college girl should be, forgetting to have any fun along the way. Edward might have a say in what Betty Jo does on her date with Chuck. Meanwhile, Uncle Joe is collecting loose pieces of string to roll into one really big ball.",

She and Betty Jo try and get someone to switch classes with Walter so that he can transfer out of home ec.

Uncle Joe uses some sly tactics to try and get the jury of the current case sequestered at the Shady Rest rather than the much closer Pixley Hotel. He manages to do so. Joe doesn't mind the extra work and inconvenience to Kate and the girls. Those inconveniences include figuring out sleeping assignments for the shortage of rooms, lack of food due to an extra hungry jury, the jurors' personal lives invading the hotel, and certain parts of the hotel being off limits during the jury's deliberation. But when that inconvenience extends to Joe, he may wonder if getting the business and money is worth the crimp on their collective lives.",

    "description": "Kate receives a letter from a Mr. Donald Dobble stating that he and his friend and business colleague would like a reservation for two rooms. Mr. Dobble's friend, Mr. David Benton, arrives, and says that Mr. Dobble is with him, but Kate sees no one but Mr. Benton. Despite Mr. Benton seeming crazy to Kate since he sees and talks to an \"invisible\" man, Kate checks them in to the two reserved rooms. Her stance is that Mr. Benton is probably overworked and needs some much needed rest and relaxation. But as time goes on, Kate is wondering if she is the one going crazy for not being able to see Mr. Dobble. She feels this way as although Uncle Joe and the girls haven't seen him either, they have never been in a situation with Mr. Benton talking directly to Mr. Dobble in the room and they don't seem overly concerned that they have yet to see Mr. Dobble. So Kate tries at whatever opportunity to sneak a peak at or speak directly to Mr. Dobble, instead of just seeing the indirect implications that a Mr. Dobble is indeed there. Is Kate fighting a losing battle in trying to see the elusive and perhaps non-existent Mr. Dobble?",

For the business, they are in competition with the Pixley Hotel, which may have an elevator and telephones, but doesn't have Kate's home cooking. To be on the safe side, Kate decides to do a face lift of the hotel's rooms before the convention organizer's inspection, with Uncle Joe to do much of the work. Kate also receives notice of a property tax increase of $6, the amount about which Kate is relieved but Uncle Joe is livid, although he states he is angry about the increase on principle. Unknown to Kate, Uncle Joe writes a scathing letter to the tax review board demanding the taxes be lowered. Problems ensue not only for Uncle Joe, but Kate when Uncle Joe confuses the visit by the convention organizer, Mr. Forbes, with the visit by J.C. Albright, the chair of the tax review board, to who Uncle Joe wants to make the hotel look as shabby and run-down as possible to justify the tax decrease.",

As such, the Pixley Hotel's owner, Murdock Sneep, feigning that his establishment is also full, proposes to Kate that they merge their businesses. Kate kindly declines as she knows how empty the Pixley Hotel is. As such, Sneep vows to ruin Kate. He starts with an aggressive local advertising campaign, which doesn't bother Kate. But when Sneep starts to advertise on Shady Rest property, Kate and Uncle Joe believe his act is the start of war. Both Sneep and Kate/Uncle Joe have the same sorts of ideas as they try to one up the other. The first question becomes whether Kate or Sneep will realize first that their war may be reaping business but is taking a bigger bite in their expenses. And the second question is whether or not anyone else can capitalize on their feud.",

    "description": "With the hotel empty and bills piling up, Kate needs an influx of revenue, which means someone, namely Uncle Joe, has to find a paying job. Although Uncle Joe pounds the pavement, he does whatever he can to dissuade anyone from hiring him. On Uncle Joe's rounds with Dog, Dog, in an empty lot for sale in Pixley, digs up a tin can full of money. Initially, Uncle Joe plans on not telling Kate about the money, but rather spend it on himself so that he can live in luxury in the big city, but Dog guilts him into doing the right thing. So Uncle Joe secretly pays off all Kate's bills. A surprised Kate has no idea who her benefactor is, and thus has no idea who to thank. When Uncle Joe learns that the money was probably stolen from the Crabwell Corners Bank, he tries to return what's left of it to the bank without appearing to be involved in the robbery.",

It gives Uncle Joe the idea to market the hotel as a second honeymoon haven for past honeymooning guests. The girls, who think it's a good idea, build upon it by suggesting they hold a gala reunion. They'll send out invitations with stamped return envelopes, so that all the invitees have to do is fill in the dates they will be staying on their RSVP. The plan doesn't work as every single couple to who they send invitations turn them down. The unfortunate recipients of the plan end up being the Andersons, who wanted a quiet second honeymoon, but receive Uncle Joe's constant attention as he wants to document every single second of their visit for his \"Shady Rest Second Honeymoon\" brochure. Uncle Joe's meddling has an unexpected second result which could put the kibosh on the whole second honeymoon haven idea.",

The arrival of the store catalog seems to be the big event for the girls, but they can't buy anything since the bank turned down Kate's loan request. Kate realizes that she has never been able to make a go of the hotel, but she can't imagine the girls or Uncle Joe ever wanting to move away. Mr. Carter Deming, a writer and the only current guest at the hotel, overhears Kate's musings, and as he gets ten times more work done at the hotel than he does in his own home in New York, he offers to buy the hotel from Kate. When the girls and Uncle Joe imply that they'd love to live in New York City (without Kate mentioning the reason why she's asking) and when Mr. Deming offers Kate much more than the hotel is really worth, Kate reluctantly accepts Mr. Deming's offer for what she feels is the good and the want of the rest of the family, especially in the ability to send the girls to college with that money. But when Kate tells them the news, the reality of their love for the Shady Rest and Hooterville and their want to stay sink in. As Kate verbally promised Mr. Deming that she wouldn't back out of the deal, Uncle Joe feels the only way to be able to stay is to have Mr. Deming want to back out.",

Although no one is around when Kate starts the job, she manages to find Uncle Joe (who wants to start an antiques business with his junk), Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo, but Betty Jo, who should have have been on the afternoon Cannonball run from school, isn't around. Kate receives news from Floyd and Charlie that last they saw Betty Jo that morning, she, all made up and with suitcase in hand, looked like she was about to run away to elope. Worried that Betty Jo has done something foolish, Kate, with help from the other girls, look for clues in Betty Jo's room and find that if Betty Jo is indeed planning to elope, the groom's name is Peter Latimer, a new boy in town. Kate does what any concerned mother would, and that is to rush off to find and stop Betty Jo from getting married.",

Their relationship is going very slowly as Ronnie has never been married and seems to be a confirmed bachelor as he has lived on his own for virtually all his life. So when Kate runs into Ronnie, she tries to encourage him to take his relationship with Vera a little more seriously and a little more quickly. To help him along, she allows Ronnie to stay at the hotel to see how happy real family life really is. Two problems arise. First, there is currently less than harmony at the hotel among the feuding sisters. And second, Ronnie's stay at the hotel is misconstrued by others, who think Ronnie and Kate are sweet on each other. Those others include Uncle Joe, who believes Ronnie is a fortune hunter after the family's money.",

However, Uncle Joe, and by association the girls, become concerned for Kate, thinking she needs to get out herself. So the girls take it upon themselves to try and find her an eligible bachelor. Before they can do that, they feel they have to demonstrate that they're grown up now, since they believe Kate's reluctance to date is because of her need to take care of them. In their overall scheme, the girls first try the direct approach, which doesn't work. Then they try the tricky approach, which has unintended consequences and still doesn't work. So they try the sneaky approach, bringing in the person they believe can help them the most: worldly Mrs. Douglas. Since all the eligible bachelors are scattered all over the valley, Mrs. Douglas suggests holding a lonely hearts club gathering at the hotel. Complications ensue when three desperate men show up at the hotel looking for equally desperate women and who won't leave until they find the woman of their dreams, while Kate initially has no idea what's going on.",

Uncle Joe wants to exploit the benefits of the lake, such as market the hotel as the place to stay for tourists using the lake for recreational purposes, and corner the market in the provision of whatever specialized products and services for those tourists. However, Kate points out to Uncle Joe that there is one flaw in his plans: the location of the new lake does not mean that the hotel will be lake front property, but rather be under water in the middle of the lake. The railroad spur line would also be under water. When she sees how this project will devastate her and the Cannonball, she knows who is behind it: Homer Bedloe. Kate does whatever she can to stop the project, her first order of business being to collect two hundred signatures required on a restraining order petition. When it looks like Kate will just run short of the required two hundred, Floyd and Charley unwittingly look like they will get the last of the signatures required, but it is ultimately Dog who looks like he will do what is required to stop Bedloe's scheme.",

Kate allows her to do so only if she is able to come up with the money, which may not be that easy for Betty Jo. After placing a job wanted ad in the World Guardian (which she could only pay for by dusting Sam's store in exchange), Betty Jo does get a babysitting offer only on the condition that Kate is around to supervise, to which Kate reluctantly agrees. With Kate doing much of the work, Betty Jo makes it through the babysitting job. The result is that many other babysitting offers and many other babies come out of the woodwork. Unfortunately for Betty Jo and the the rest of the family, the jobs are all for the same night and under the same condition of Kate supervising. Despite all the help provided by Kate and ultimately Bobbie Jo and Uncle Jo on these jobs, Betty Jo has to come to a decision if there are more important things in her life than the motorbike.",

    "description": "Until the hundreds of entries come flooding in, Kate is unaware that Uncle Joe had advertised a free honeymoon letter writing contest for the hotel. He wanted to take advantage of the photographs he got of the honeymooning couple that recently stayed there. He figures that the free publicity and resulting business will more than make up the cost of running the contest. Out of all the entries, only one stands out: that of Laura Bentley and Tony Allison, a young couple whose parents will not allow them to get married. Thus, winning the contest is their only chance to have some semblance of a romantic honeymoon following their elopement. They are voted the winning couple. However, when they arrive at the hotel, they are not quite as the Bradleys had anticipated: they are an elderly couple whose respective grown children objected to their marriage. Regardless, Kate and the girls want to give them the best elopement and honeymoon the hotel has ever seen. Two obstacles stand in their way: Laura's daughter Violet, and Tony's son Herbert, who arrive just in time to stop the wedding. Kate tries a little reverse psychology to get the bride and groom back on track, but Kate's ploy has an unintended consequence which threatens not only the wedding but Laura and Tony's relationship altogether.",

The pilot, distracted by the beautiful creatures he sees in the water tower, crashes the plane by the railroad tracks next to the hotel. As the injured pilot is unconscious, the family manages to carry him up to the hotel. For all three girls, it's love at first sight with the handsome pilot. What they are able to glean from information in his wallet is that his name is Steve Elliott, he's twenty-four and has an honorable discharge from the air force. Each of the girls do whatever they can to gain Steve's favor while they nurse him back to health. Once Steve regains consciousness and sees the girls, he too will do whatever he can to stay at the hotel as long as possible, even at the expense of his damaged plane and the income he earns from it. Kate and the girls later learn directly from Steve that that income is from crop dusting. However, Uncle Joe believes Steve's a Russian spy. Steve tries to use Uncle Joe's belief to his advantage.",

One very interested party is Henry Sharp, who actually owns the plane. The heartless Sharp has come by as Steve has missed a payment. Steve is in trouble as he barely has enough money to repair the plane let alone make his regular payments. When attempts to put off Sharp fail, Steve decides to cut corners in terms of the plane repair, while Kate, the girls and Uncle Joe try to help him raise some money, which ends up not being an easy task. Being that Sunday is approaching, they may have to make a request to higher powers. If their plan works, the downside for the Bradley clan is that Steve will soon be leaving the valley.",

At least one - who has been doodling the name \"B.J. Elliott\" - if not more is even expecting Steve to marry her imminently. To bring her daughters back down to earth, Kate believes she has to tell Steve the girls' thoughts, he who had some suspicion that their feelings had gone that far. Steve has no intention on marrying anyone at this point in his life. Kate and Steve devise a plan to scare off each of the girls. Their plan has unexpected results. But Steve also has to decide if any of the three is the one he would like at least initially to date.",

    "description": "Since she is now in junior college, Bobbie Jo thinks she's all grown up, and as a grown up she can make her own decisions. The latest decision that she's made is to go to an all night party with her friends - the evening is to start with a dance in the school gym lasting until midnight, followed by the all night party at the country club. Kate refuses to let her go to the all-nighter, despite Bobbie Jo telling her that all the other mothers are letting their daughters go. Later seeing those mothers, Kate learns that none of the mothers want their daughters to stay out all night. Kate provides what she thinks is a reasonable compromise: Bobbie Jo can stay out until 01:30 - Kate has made arrangements with Floyd and Charlie to have the Cannonball ready to pick the girls up at that time - which would allow Bobbie Jo to at least go out for a midnight snack following the school dance. Leaving for the dance with her date Scott, Bobbie Jo is ready to defy Kate and stay out all night as all the other girls are planning on doing. But if Bobbie Jo does miss the 01:30 train, she'll miss the surprise Kate has waiting for her and the others on the Cannonball.",

They believe the reason for the derailment was that Floyd had removed too many of the railroad ties to stoke the engine. Floyd counters that he only took those that were deteriorating because of the worm holes. To get the Cannonball repaired and back into service, Uncle Joe takes matters into his own hands by calling the C&FW Railroad, who agree to pay the necessary $300 insurance deductible for the repairs. Kate doesn't think that what Uncle Joe did was such a good idea since it will probably mean the imminent arrival of Homer Bedloe. Kate's right. But Bedloe initially seems to want to cooperate. His true mission comes to light when he finds about what Floyd did, meaning that a railroad employee's negligence caused the accident which in turns means the insurance company will not pay which means he will not be repairing the train. Kate, however, comes up with an alternate plan in discussion with the insurance company: they will fix the train if ten valley residents put up $30 security apiece to be a \"stockholder\" of the train. Kate is able to raise the necessary money. Kate's plan may derail the Cannonball a second time as the new stockholders request unreasonable and impractical operating procedures from Charley and Floyd, while Bedloe watches from the sidelines in delight.",

    "description": "Selma is even less cordial to Kate than usual. Based on Selma's purchases at Drucker's and her implication, Sam and Kate surmise that Selma is beautifying Henrietta to snag a husband, with that probable target being the valley's new, eligible bachelor who happens to have a bright and seemingly lucrative aviation future, namely Steve. They're right as Selma tries to throw both money into Steve's crop dusting business and gourmet meals to entice Steve. Despite Billie Jo and Steve now officially dating, Kate vows to stay out of the matter. Billie Jo, on the other hand, feels she needs to fight as dirty as Selma is to keep Steve, and enlists the help of the dirtiest fighter she knows: Uncle Joe. When Selma ramps up her fight one notch by moving herself and Henrietta into the hotel to be closer to Steve, Kate, who can no longer silently witness the direct dirty tactics against Billie Jo, comes up with a plan to kibosh Selma's want for Steve as a son-in-law. Kate first has to convince Charley and Floyd to help her, they who still have a grudge against Steve solely because as a pilot he is the railroader's enemy.",

    "description": "It's almost time for the Almost Annual Charity Show, and everyone is looking forward to Steve and Billie Jo performing a duet together. Those at the Shady Rest are thrown for a loop when Selma announces that she has been appointed the show's committee chair, a job usually held by Kate. In actuality, Selma strong-armed Sam, the overseer of the show, into appointing her. Regardless, Selma wants a few changes to the performing roster, including Steve singing with Henrietta instead. If he refuses, he doesn't perform at all. After Steve refuses to be bullied by Selma, a gracious Billie Jo tells Steve to go ahead and sing with Henrietta. A worse change is that Selma makes herself the headliner, she playing the part of a singing Cleopatra. When news spreads around the valley of Selma's starring role, ticket sales plummet. Kate sets up a money back guarantee scheme at least to get people to the auditorium. But Uncle Joe, with help from Bobbie Jo and Betty Jo, thinks he has a way for the audience to enjoy the show and thus not want their money back.",

She believes his life as a pilot is a dangerous one and as such she would like to see him in a different profession. So when she learns that Steve has a journalism background, she tries to convince Sam to turn over the running of the Hooterville World Guardian to Steve. Sam agrees as he doesn't have time to do the newspaper justice. With no crop dusting work to be had in the valley, Steve accepts the offer. This move doesn't sit well with Uncle Joe, the supposed president of the Carson-Elliott crop dusting dynasty. To show Kate that this move was one done in error, Joe goes on a quest for crop dusting business from their valley neighbors. With seemingly no bugs infesting the crops and thus no business, Joe tries instead to manufacture some business through some devious means.",

As Uncle Joe and girls contemplate a rekindling of their mother and Walter's romance, a nervous Kate doesn't want to presuppose anything about Walter's visit.

Bobbie Jo has stopped accepting dates from everyone except Steve and Don. Although neither Steve or Don have asked anyone to the dance yet, Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo are certain that they will be the two lucky girls going to the dance with Steve and Don, with Billie Jo believing she has the right of first choice being the oldest. Through all this wrangling between sisters, the left out sister is Betty Jo, who feels she has as much right to be included in the dating discussion. This exclusion is just the latest in the long line of snubs at being the young Bradley girl. The snub not only seems to be from Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo, but all the boys of the valley as well as the only person who has asked her to the dance is Eb, and only because he was turned down by Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo. Not wanting to take it anymore, Betty Jo decides to strike out on her own by getting a job. But a little help from both Steve and Don may show the world in a better light that Betty Jo is all grown up.",

    "description": "Young Doc Don Craig announces that he's leaving the valley since there just isn't enough business for him and Doc Stuart. Kate and the girls try to drum up business for him, which includes convincing him to examine Fred Ziffel's pig, Arnold. But based on Doc Craig's latest cases, Kate thinks she's come up with a solution for him to stay: that he specialize in house calls for people who can't make it into the office. He enlists the help of Floyd and Charley, who wait for him as he makes his stops along the rail line. Meanwhile, Kate has another problem: the imminent arrival to the valley of Homer Bedloe. His visit is to see what trouble he can stir up to shut down the Cannonball. Bedloe thinks he can use Doc Craig's new business as a reason to shut down the train. When Kate figures out what Bedloe is up to, they have a race against time to get the train to the end of the line in Hooterville. They have to decide if winning that race should be at the short term expense of medical and rail service to valley residents.",

That means Billie Jo, or so Kate and Billie Jo believe. Although Billie Jo sees it as an honor, she doesn't really want to leave Steve for an entire weekend. However, Selma, a club member, doesn't ever remember voting for someone to fill the position permanently, and she wants to hold a special vote just before the convention to elect a permanent recording secretary. Despite Billie Jo having done the job since she was sixteen, Selma is pushing for Henrietta, regardless of Henrietta not knowing how to type or take shorthand, if only to send her instead of Billie Jo to the convention. Billie Jo remembers the meeting when she first started, and indeed she was only to fill the position temporarily until a vote could be held to elect a permanent secretary. The outcome of the resulting vote, with only Billie Jo and Henrietta on the ballot, is a tie. Both Selma and Kate think they have the answer to breaking the tie with their respective daughter coming out on top. Both daughters may have other things on their mind.",

He's come to make an announcement of a new appointment of general manager for the Cannonball, that person who will oversee the train's operations. That person is Uncle Joe. Uncle Joe begins to act like a tyrant in bossing around Charley and Floyd, and making them operate the train against their sensibilities. Not only Charley and Floyd, but also everyone in the valley are mad at Uncle Joe for his new operating rules. As such, Charley and Floyd quit leaving Uncle Joe to operate the train on his own, he who doesn't really know how. That's when Bedloe's reason for appointing Uncle Joe comes to light: Norman Curtis, President of the CF&W is arriving shortly to make an inspection. Kate has to try and convince Charley and Floyd into resuming their jobs so that the train can look to be operating efficiently, as opposed to the inefficient operation by Uncle Joe. They may have a problem in doing so after Uncle Joe's finished doing a job on the train.",

With their own transportation broken down, Mr. Morton, the film crew director, needs Steve to fly him immediately to make a connection to a flight to New York. However, Hamlet can't risk the flight in Steve's plane, so he has to stay at the Shady Rest under the care of Uncle Joe until Mr. Morton can pick him up later. With all the special treatment Uncle Joe and the girls give Hamlet, Dog feels like the forgotten family member. So, Dog runs off. Feeling like Hamlet needs to earn his keep, Uncle Joe makes Hamlet track Dog's scent. In the quest, everyone comes to realization who is really the valuable dog, but it could be a costly realization as Hamlet goes missing just before Mr. Morton is scheduled to return.",

Bobbie Jo, who told all her friends about the date with the most sought after boy in her class, feels that she can't ask anyone else in that social circle to the dance since he would know that he was second choice. But as Billie Jo and Steve recently had a fight where Billie Jo isn't speaking to him anymore, Bobbie Jo feels that Steve is fair game as a potential date to the dance. Bobbie Jo even asks Billie Jo if it's all right, and Billie Jo gives her consent. Steve accepts Bobbie Jo's invitation. Following, Tommy tells Bobbie Jo that he now can make it to the dance since that other commitment is no more. Since she already has a date with Steve, she now refuses Tommy. Feeling Tommy now fair game, Betty Jo wants to ask him to the dance. Betty Jo in turn asks Bobbie Jo if it's all right if she asks Tommy to the dance, to which Bobbie Jo gives her consent. Tommy says yes to Betty Jo's invitation. The problem with these pairings is that Billie Jo feels jealous about Bobbie Jo's date with \"her\" boyfriend, and Bobbie Jo feels jealous about Betty Jo's date with \"her\" boyfriend. Add to the mix Jerry Massett, a mechanic friend of Steve's from his air force days, who is visiting Hooterville. Jerry ends up asking a free Billie Jo to the dance, which makes Steve jealous.",

Meanwhile, Betty Jo has a new, somewhat unwanted friend. A quiet, little boy who she doesn't know but played catch with is following her around, even back to the hotel. Everyone at the hotel doesn't know what to do with Clint - which they eventually learn is his name - except to make sure he's OK until they find out to who he belongs. They finally learn that his father is Jeremiah Priddy and that Clint ran away as Mr. Priddy is less than a friendly or hospitable man. Mr. Priddy deals with his son much as he deals with anyone who drinks: unyielding. Kate has a change of heart about Mr. Priddy when she learns a little more about him. She uses this information to try and bring him and Clint closer together.",

The winning performer of the Station K audition is to receive $200. Once Uncle Joe hears about the prize money, he thinks that Steve and Billie Jo should enter. Billie Jo loves the idea, but Steve, who had never even considered singing for money, is less than enthusiastic. But he agrees to perform with Billie Jo. Sydney Sparks, a talent agent who heard Steve and Billie Jo, wants to represent them if they win the contest. His plans are for them to go on the road as a nightclub act. Most of the family have mixed emotions about the news, they who are happy for the potential new career, but sad to see Steve and Billie Jo possibly leave for good. The two people who don't have mixed emotions are Steve and Billie Jo. Billie Jo wants to do it and sees no down side. On the other hand, Steve doesn't as he doesn't want to be continually on the road living out of a suitcase. Uncle Joe thinks he may have a way so that Steve and Billie Jo don't have to make the decision themselves.",

    "description": "As Pixley's Sheriff Crandall is on a fishing vacation, Uncle Joe has made an arrangement with Sam, the valley's justice of the peace, to house kleptomaniac shoplifter, Eustace Pockle, at the hotel for $4 a day for a five day sentence or until the sheriff's return. Despite Eustace's relatively harmless nature, Kate doesn't like the idea, but allows Eustace to stay. Unfortunately for Kate and the hotel guests, Uncle Joe treats the hotel more like a jail than a hotel. Conversely, Kate and the girls treat Eustace more like a hotel guest than a prisoner. Eustace, on the other hand, treats the hotel like any other place: somewhere to snatch trinkets. Just as Sheriff Crandall has announced his early return to pick-up Eustace, Eustace escapes from the Shady Rest, which places Kate and Uncle Joe in some hot water. They hope to be able to find him before Sheriff Crandall actually makes it back.",

He got her an audition at the Flamingo Room in Springdale. Kate isn't too sure that she wants Billie Jo to pursue this career, but with Billie Jo being twenty-one and of age, there's no way she can stop her. Following the audition, Billie Jo is certain she got the job. Kate, however, isn't so sure her daughter's right as they told her \"don't call us, we'll call you\". When Kate receives the news for Billie Jo that she didn't get the job - only because she didn't have a big enough name to draw in customers - Kate has a change of heart about Billie Jo and this job. With help from Uncle Joe and Sam, Kate thinks she knows a way for Mr. Austin, the Flamingo Room's manager, to change his mind. Regardless, Billie Jo, based on an off the cuff comment by Uncle Joe, may kibosh her own chances of show business success by her warped sense of what it means to be a star.",

Billie Jo becomes jealous of her younger sister, who hasn't really yet figured out that she's no longer a little girl, a fact pointed out to her by her mother. Billie Jo tries to be more like Betty Jo - being a grease monkey however not really in Billie Jo's nature - while Betty Jo tries to act more grown up in an effort for others to see her in a more feminine light. Neither Billie Jo or Betty Jo achieve what they want. Betty Jo in particular feels let down as she wanted to feel like a threat to Billie Jo, while Steve still sees her solely as a grease monkey tomboy. After Steve's attempts to make it up to Betty Jo while letting her down easily fail, Betty Jo decides to take drastic measures to get what she wants.",

The implication of the message is that Max wants Steve as a business partner up in Cascade Valley. Steve quickly makes the decision not to accept Max's offer, but Steve joking about it irks Billie Jo, who wishes that he would take the future of their relationship more seriously. Kate suggests to Steve that Max join him in Hooterville, which Steve knows wouldn't work but doesn't say why. Regardless, without Steve's knowledge, Uncle Joe sends a reply telegram to Max, asking him to relocate to Hooterville to join the Carson-Elliott Enterprises. Max decides at least to investigate, which doesn't sit well with Max's business and personal partner. Max's arrival in Hooterville shows why Steve wasn't so interested in Max coming for a visit. Not only does Max's visit in and of itself cause some complications, but also the need for Max to get an agricultural flying license from the state capitol, which Billie Jo and the the rest of the family misinterpret.",

    "description": "Business at the Shady Rest is worse than usual which is bringing Kate down. Instead of looking for a job to raise money which was his original plan, Uncle Joe speaks to Sam about the Shady Rest and Drucker's Store jointly hosting a fishing derby on Lost Lake. Uncle Joe figures that they can advertise expensive prizes, such as a boat, outboard motor and fishing gear, and order the prizes on a 30-day layaway plan. Since Sam and Uncle Joe have collectively caught the biggest fish on Lost Lake year after year, he figures one of the two of them will win the derby and they can return the prizes before the 30 days. In the meantime, the hotel will be filled up and Drucker's Store will be busy with new customers. Sam agrees if only to help Kate, who has no idea of the underlying scam when she agrees to the derby. The derby does bring in business both to the hotel and store, but it also brings in many fishers, one in particular who seems able to out-fish Sam and Uncle Joe and has more than an excellent chance of winning the derby, which would put Kate in even worse financial shape.",

    "description": "Without telling anyone in the valley the reason why, the anyone who includes the family, Kate takes a trip into the big city. It isn't until her return that she divulges the reason to everyone: she decided to sell the hotel and she went to the city to finalize the terms of the deal with the buyer, Mr. Holloway, a chain hotelier. The money from the sale will provide any opportunity the girls want. Beyond the valley residents who are sad to see Kate and the girls leave, the girls themselves are initially happy about the news and being able to live out their dreams. But they all come to the realization that part of their dream still does include calling the Shady Rest home, especially after Steve announces that he's staying regardless. Kate comes to understand what life in Hooterville and at the Shady Rest really means to them all, including herself, but she feels that she made a verbal agreement with Mr. Holloway of which she ethically cannot back out. Uncle Joe tries to use a little emotional blackmail to convince Kate not to sign to final papers.",

Sam ends up devoting the entire front page of the World Guardian to Bobbie Jo and her poem's publication. The notoriety changes Bobbie Jo, who begins to get \"inspired\" by the most mundane things. She also starts hanging out with a beatnik, pseudo-intellectual coffee house crowd. When Kate learns from Steve that the coffee house she is hanging out in in Springdale isn't quite what Kate had first imagined, Kate needs to see it first hand to see if it is a place suitable for Bobbie Jo. Kate takes extreme measures to show Bobbie Jo that being beatnik does not always equate to true art and intellectualism.",

After Jeff hits on Billie Jo, Jeff can understand when Steve tells him that Billie Jo is off limits since the two of them are going together.

    "description": "Late one evening, Uncle Joe and Sam, following a lodge meeting, run across a mysterious fellow looking for lodging. He calls himself Dr. Isaac Newton and claims that he's a geophysicist. Although Kate welcomes him with open arms, she and the rest of the family think that his all-knowing behavior, and the mysterious occurrences that have happened that night - which includes a lot of flickering lights - are not human. They believe he may be an alien from outer space. Despite the secretive nature of the club, the men offer to hold their upcoming lodge meeting, where Uncle Joe is going through an important initiation process, at the hotel if only to ensure that Kate and the girls feel safe from Dr. Newton. Goings-on during and after the initiation ceremony ultimately settle Kate's mind about Dr. Newton.",

So that he won't be lonely, Billie Jo asks her sisters to keep Steve company. Bobbie Jo and Betty Jo take Billie Jo's request a little too to heart, and ask him out on what they consider official dates. They each treat Steve like their own boyfriend, at the exclusion of their current beaus. This situation places a potential strain between the younger sisters and Billie Jo - Bobbie Jo who sees that all is fair in love and war - but neither Bobbie Jo or Betty Jo initially see that the other too is interested in him. Kate thinks she has the answer for a confused Steve, but that doesn't solve the problem about what to tell Billie Jo when she returns. Meanwhile, Uncle Joe is trying to install an electronic room service request system, much to Kate's chagrin.",

Cousin Mae, who is enamored by gallant men, unintentionally causes problems between Floyd and Charley, who recently and happily celebrated their twenty-fifth anniversary of working together. The problem is is that both men want to court Cousin Mae. They both will do whatever they can do earn Cousin Mae's favor, even if it means breaking up their professional partnership and their friendship. Seeing what is happening between Charley and Floyd, Kate thinks she has a plan to bring the two friends back together, but Kate's plan worsens the matter. So she turns to Plan B, which entails having a chat with Cousin Mae, who it seems is used to being the cause of bickering between men.",

They are the valley's two hundred fiftieth and two hundred fifty-first residents, pushing the valley's population over the magic two hundred fifty mark which means Hooterville is now eligible to have a representative on the County Board of Supervisors. Sam scoffs at Kate's suggestion of Elmira Peabody, the local schoolteacher, as a good candidate for Supervisor, Sam's scoffing solely because Elmira's a woman. That act by Sam sets off a battle of the sexes for Hooterville's Board representative, the men who eventually decide to back Sam (with Uncle Joe as his campaign manager) and the women who eventually decide to back Kate (with Selma as her campaign manager). With the valley equally divided based on gender, both sides feel the best way to win is gain the vote of those in the valley who have no previous allegiance, namely the Tuttles. The women try to convince Henry to vote for Kate, while the men try to convince Wilma to vote for Sam. Henry and Wilma make their stand in the situation known in a slightly different way besides the ballot box.",

    "description": "Kate's cousin, Mae Belle Jennings, writes stating that she is coming for a visit with some big plans for the hotel. Along with her letter are some mod clothes for Kate and girls, which are part of the plan. Upon Mae's arrival, she tells them that with some backing from a wealthy banker, she plans on turning the Shady Rest into a health farm using a diet and exercise regimen called the \"Mae Method Reducing Course\". The only stipulation for the financing is that the banker's daughter, a slightly overweight woman named Agnes Bedford, has to lose fifteen pounds in two weeks while staying at the hotel using the Mae Method. However, Mae herself can't stay as she has to go back and deal with the banker, leaving Kate to administer the Mae Method for Agnes in her place. The clothes are for Kate and the girls to be visual inspirations to show Agnes what she can look like after she loses the weight. Uncle Joe is all for the idea until Kate tells him that he will be the male guinea pig of the Mae Method to show that it works on both men and women. Agnes, who loves her food, isn't the easiest person to convert to this new way of life. They just hope that Agnes, who shows some early weight loss during her stay, will be able to reach her goal by the time Mae returns. Kate, the girls and Uncle Joe's reward system for Agnes doesn't help their cause.",

    "description": "The family is awaiting the return of Betty Jo, who has been traveling through Europe for the past three months. The trip was a graduation present from Kate's cousin Mae. Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo believe that the trip probably has changed Betty Jo, who will not want to see all her childhood belongings that Kate has so prominently displayed in Betty Jo's bedroom. Kate, in this act of decorating Betty Jo's room, doesn't think anything, even this exciting trip, will have changed Betty Jo. But Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo are right. Accompanying Betty Jo from New York City are three \"friends\" - Peter, Brad and Ronnie - who are all stuck up and pretentious, just like Betty Jo is now. Unknown to Betty Jo, who says farewell to them at the city airport, Peter, Brad and Ronnie plan to make their way to Hooterville and the Shady Rest to see first hand Betty Jo's rural life. Upon their arrival, Betty Jo becomes ashamed and embarrassed of her background as she tries to put on airs for her three friends. In the process, Betty Jo comes to know who her real friends and loved ones are, and who she really is.",

Beyond the snagging a husband part, Kate agrees and offers to teach Betty Jo. But Betty Jo may be on her own after Kate, who sees one of Billie Jo's costumes for her nightclub act at the Flamingo Room, demands to go with Billie Jo to provide her first hand motherly critique of Billie Jo's career. Kate can't help but be the typical stage mother in trying to protect Billie Jo. But Kate may have bigger issues with which to deal when she telephones home to see how things are going. When Sam tells her not to worry since \"there's nothing you can do about it now\" - Sam referring to the fact that Steve became ill after eating Betty Jo's cooking - Kate jumps to a conclusion, a wrong one, but one that makes her rush back home to save her youngest from what she considers a big mistake.",

    "description": "While flying back from Springdale, Steve and Betty Jo are caught in an unexpected thunderstorm. Although there were some tense moments - for both those up in the air and those on the ground waiting for them - Steve and Betty Jo make it down safely. The emotions from their experience together throw Steve and Betty Jo into each others' arms, which turns into one of the first expressions that they are falling in love with each other. Betty Jo confides her feelings for Steve to her mother, who cautions her to take a wait and see approach and not jump to conclusions about Steve's feelings. But Steve later confirms with Kate that he indeed does have those feelings for her youngest daughter. This news places a possible strain in the Bradley family with the other two girls, especially Billie Jo, who Steve has been going with for quite some time. While Kate tries to figure out a way to smooth the possible rough waters with Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo, Steve may take matters into his own hands, unless another thunderstorm or some other human intervention gets in his way.",

Steve implies as much to her that he does intend to marry Betty Jo. Kate doesn't know what to think as she still sees Betty Jo as her little girl. After a chat with Sam, who ends up being her voice of reason, Kate decides to give Steve her blessing to propose. That's just the first hurdle for Steve, who is pretty sure that Betty Jo will say yes, but there still is that small part of him that is scared she'll say no. So Steve and Kate, without telling anyone else what's going on, try to arrange the perfect setting for a romantic proposal and a positive outcome. One thing or another seems to be getting in the way for Steve to ask the question. Steve may have to hurry when Uncle Joe gets wind of what's going on, news which he is happy to spread across the valley.",

    "description": "Secluded in the woods near Pixley and literally a stone's throw away from the rail line, Betty Jo has found what she believes is the perfect house for herself and Steve for after their marriage. Perfection is in the eye of the beholder as once Betty Jo is able to locate the house once again to show Steve and Kate, all Steve and Kate can see in the building is an old, dilapidated shack, and one that has no bathroom to boot. Steve wants to be supportive of Betty Jo's dream - which in this case is a difficult thing to do - so he makes an off the cuff comment about the up side of owning that house. That comment places a strain between Steve and Betty Jo, one that could be a deal breaker for their relationship and upcoming marriage. While Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo side with and support their sister in the matter, Kate tries to talk some sense into Steve and particularly Betty Jo to get their future life together back on track.",

He eventually confides in Kate, but doesn't mention who the girl is, not wanting to jinx the situation. Even after it looks like Floyd has proposed and the girl accepted, he doesn't divulge who she is. After he asks Steve for an unusual and huge favor, everyone at the Shady Rest is more curious than ever about who the girl is. Uncle Joe, who once took a private investigator's course, believes he can uncover the identity of the mystery girl. One key piece of evidence is Floyd's request to Steve, which is deemed uncharacteristic of Floyd's nature. But Kate knows a surefire way to find out: Selma, the biggest gossip in town. Kate has to try to get the information from Selma without Selma figuring out that they don't know. Selma does readily divulge the information, which throws everyone into a tailspin and threatens to ruin Steve and Betty Jo's own wedding.",

    "description": "Steve and Betty Jo's wedding is fast approaching. They are working hard trying to complete the renovations on their cottage by the time of the wedding, which is a tall order. Thrown into the mix is a letter from Steve's parents, Mr. & Mrs. Donald Elliott, who have decided imminently to stop by Hooterville on their way to a business meeting. Although Steve doesn't see their visit as a big deal and although their letter states that the Bradleys should not make a fuss, Betty Jo is freaked by one other line in the letter: \"We just want to meet your Betty Jo, have one of her delicious meals, and see your dream house.\" Steve stretched the truth about Betty Jo's cooking and the cottage when writing home to his parents. With Kate's coaching, Betty Jo is determined to prepare dinner for her new in-laws. That may not come to pass when Kate is ordered bed-rest by Doc Stuart for what looks to be a 48-hour cold. With Betty Jo stuck in the kitchen alone without Kate, there is little time for her and Steve to complete the renos on the cottage for Mr. & Mrs. Elliott to see a \"dream house\". Betty Jo's ability to impress the Elliotts may be a total bust both on the food and house fronts unless there is some divine intervention, or at least that of some people who really know what's going on.",

    "description": "On a trip into Riverdale, Betty Jo finds what she thinks is the perfect wedding dress, which she takes back to Shady Rest to show Kate for approval. What Betty Jo is unaware of is that Uncle Joe has bought her a wedding dress himself, that in a country style with a big sunflower emblazoned on the front. Also upon her arrival, Kate's cousin Mae comes bearing another wedding dress for Betty Jo, a mini dress off the fashion runways of Paris, complete with white high heeled boots. Neither Uncle Joe or Cousin Mae are aware that Betty Jo has bought her own dress. As much as she loves both Uncle Joe and Cousin Mae, neither of the dresses they got for her are her style, but she doesn't have the heart to tell them that she plans on wearing her own purchased dress for fear of hurting their feelings. Billie Jo thinks she has the solution to all Betty Jo's wedding gown problems, Billie Jo's idea which divulges a secret that Kate herself was keeping from Betty Jo in an effort to make her daughter happy on the most important day in her life.",

The cablegram has perhaps the biggest news the valley has ever seen in its communications history: Betty Jo and Steve will be telephoning at 4pm the following day from Hawaii. The previous long distance telephone record into the valley was from Uncle Joe in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Kate and the family are excited about the news, with Kate and Sam doing whatever they can to ensure that there are no interruptions or obstacles for the telephone call to make it through. As 4pm approaches and Kate, the girls and Uncle Joe are in their Sunday best in Sam's store waiting for the call, they face unforeseen obstacles in having the telephone call be a smooth one. Meanwhile, Betty Jo and Steve, while on their honeymoon, are getting used to the idea of being Mr. & Mrs. Steve Elliott.",

Even though she is grateful for all the presents and the birthday sentiments - even the less than friendly one from Selma - she feels like one is missing, specifically from Betty Jo and Steve who are still on their honeymoon in Hawaii. Kate would have thought that they would have sent a present or a greeting of some sort on this day. But as the mail comes and goes with no gift from the honeymooners and as the day goes on with no word, Kate is empty handed but still can't believe the two would have forgotten her birthday. Neither can Uncle Joe and Sam, who go to extreme lengths to find that present, which they feel must be lost somewhere in the postal system. What everyone in Hooterville is unaware of is that Betty Jo and Steve have a special surprise for Kate for her birthday, but getting that surprise to her by the end of her actual birthday may be a bit of an issue.",

She doesn't want Steve to go to work, but since he has to, she wants to spend every other moment of his free time with him. Steve is equally still in honeymoon phase, he who wants to buy Betty Jo a three week anniversary present. So when Billie Jo announces that she got a gig for the Bradley sisters to sing at a show on Saturday night, Betty Jo has to decide what to do - sing at the show or stay at home with Steve. And when Joe and Sam invite Steve to a boys' night out for Saturday - he who really wants to go just to prove that he doesn't need Betty Jo's approval - he too has to decide what to do. Betty Jo and Steve's respective decisions test the power within the new Elliott household and whether they truly still are mentally in honeymoon phase. In the process, they learn that power may not always be the most important issue in the matter.",

    "description": "Kate receives a sickeningly sweet letter from Homer Bedloe stating that he will be imminently arriving at the Shady Rest for a few days stay. Kate knows that the sweeter the letter, the more sour the reason for Bedloe's visit. Upon his arrival, Bedloe is as sweet as his letter. He does tell Kate that the reason for his visit is that a valuable race horse is being transported from Hooterville to Pixley on the Cannonball and he wants to be on hand to make sure all goes smoothly with the job. Upon his arrival at the Shady Rest, Ray Rogers, the race horse owner, further tells Kate that the horse is ultimately being transported to Riverdale for the county fair. But when Kate sees the broken down nag that is passing for the race horse, Kate knows that Bedloe and Rogers are in cahoots to shut down the Cannonball. She just has to figure out how they plan on doing so. When she does figure out Bedloe and Rogers' scheme, Kate knows the only person who can solve their problem is Betty Jo. But Betty Jo's assistance may jeopardize her and Steve's marriage if Steve found out what's she doing. In case Steve finds out, does Kate have a plan B?",

She refuses to pay the $2 fine as her assertion is that the traffic light, which is supposed to be in operation only peak hours, was in operation during a non-peak time when she crossed against the light. So she decides to take the case to court. Besides her family, Kate, in the court of public opinion, finds that most of the people in the valley, even her friends like Sam, Floyd and even Steve, believe she's in the wrong. With the case, Kate goes back to Pixley to try and find anyone who can attest to her whereabouts on the date of the incident, showing that she was at the traffic light during an off peak time. If she can't find any witnesses, it may end up being her word against that of the ticket issuing deputy. Uncle Joe vows to help Kate prove that she's in the right, which could potentially get her into more trouble.",

Beyond Billie Jo's singing success, Uncle Joe can't help but tell of his exciting news from their stay at the fancy Omaha hotel. He applied for the Shady Rest to be listed in the Master Plan hotel directory, membership in which costs $50 just for the application. Uncle Joe figures they can get more than that money back back from the throngs of guests who learned about them from the directory. Although this scheme seems like just another of Uncle Joe's hair-brained ideas, Billie Jo, who saw the respect Uncle Joe got in Omaha as being a fellow hotelier, thinks that they should show that same respect to him instead of always laughing at him and laughing about him. As such, Kate goes along with Uncle Joe's idea behind the Master Plan. Meanwhile, they receive an unexpected hotel guest in the form of well appointed Gaylord Martindale. Although Martindale states that he's an artist by trade, Uncle Joe is certain he is the inspector from the Master Plan. As such, Uncle Joe will do anything to please him, which is a tall order as he is perhaps the most demanding guest they have ever had. This service may be at the expense of their only other guest, the very accommodating Mrs. Pruit. Kate has to decide if waiting on Martindale hand and foot at the expense of all others is worth providing Uncle Joe that respect and getting the hotel listed in the Master Plan.",

Needing some initial capital, he turns to his \"business partner\" Steve, who lends him $25 that he and Betty Jo set aside as mad money. This action leads to problems between Steve and Betty Jo, who made a pact never to lie to each other and always tell each other everything in an effort never to argue. With a little help from Kate, Steve and Betty Jo are able to weather this minor storm. But that storm reignites itself after some insect misidentification by Uncle Joe - he who thought the hornets he collected were actually bees - which leads to another argument between Steve and Betty Jo. As Steve tries to help Uncle Joe fix the problem of getting rid of the hornets, Uncle Joe may indirectly solve Steve and Betty Jo's problem by his act to get rid of the hornets on his own.",

The problem ends up being that the extremely long sofa doesn't fit in their tiny living room unless a wall gets knocked down, and the sofa was a no return sale. Betty Jo and Steve run into further problems when Steve has an idea of his own for the living room, which Betty Jo misinterprets for her own wants. An exasperated Kate gets caught in the middle, she who Betty Jo co-opts to deal with a less than flexible but more than profit hungry Mr. Agnew.",

    "description": "An excited Bobbie Jo passes on the news that she and the man of her dreams, journalism graduate student Jeff Powers, will be working on a newspaper together... perhaps. In lieu of a term paper for her journalism class, the professor has allowed students to put out an existing newspaper for a week if they can find an editor of one that will allow them to do so. Bobbie Jo is hoping Kate will ask Sam for her if she and Jeff can be the editors of the Hooterville World Guardian for the week. Kate and Bobbie Jo are surprised that Sam is more than willing to hand over the reigns. Jeff ends up having a hard hitting view of of newspaper journalism, naming names whenever they are known. Sam isn't too sure about that policy, but he changes his mind after Kate and Joe tell him that if the story is factual, it is news. Bobbie Jo may change her mind about the policy when one of the stories affects Uncle Joe negatively. If she can't change Jeff's mind about printing the story about Uncle Joe, Bobbie Jo has to decide if her personal loyalties or professional commitments, the latter which includes Jeff possibly being her boyfriend, is more important.",

Uncle Joe sees his stay as an opportunity to secure the lucrative crop dusting contract for his fields. This news will be welcome for Steve and Betty Jo, as Steve lost his latest contract due to not wanting to kowtow to the client anymore, which in turn has turned the color of their books from black to red. Uncle Joe convinces Steve to do whatever Marshall wants to secure the contract. When Steve agrees, he didn't think there would be any difficulties in doing so, until he meets Marshall's daughter, the voluptuous Millicent Marshall, who has her sights set on Steve. It seems that winning Marshall's contract means being nice to Millicent. While Uncle Joe still wants Steve to cater to both Marshall and Millicent's whims, Betty Jo, with Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo at her side, doesn't like Millicent as the competition. Caught in the middle is Steve, who has to decide if being nice to Millicent is worth the contract and possibly ruining his marriage.",

Uncle Joe comes to the conclusion that their ability to win is being hindered by one member who is singing a bunch of clunker notes. After some investigation and deduction, they realize that the offending member is Joe himself. After a discussion with Sam, Joe decides to step aside if they can find somebody to replace him. He figures they won't be able to replace irreplaceable him. He's wrong as they quickly find Grampa Jenson to fill his baritone place. Joe sees this act as mutiny, which leads to the end of his friendship with Sam. As the girls and Steve try to repair Uncle Joe and Sam's friendship, Selma, the head of the Winter Festival's judging committee, asks Joe to be the third on the panel of judges. Her request has an ulterior motive as Henrietta has entered the contest. Selma implies that she will give the Carson-Elliott Enterprises her lucrative crop dusting business if Joe votes for Henrietta. Joe is more than happy to oblige if only to spite Sam. Untalented Henrietta seems destined to win the competition unless Joe and Sam's friendship can be repaired.",

    "description": "Everyone at the hotel is worried since Dog has been gone for most of the day, the longest he's been away. Unknown to them, he ran off to Betty Jo and Steve's. When Betty Jo brings him back to the hotel later in the afternoon, Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo are angry that Betty Jo didn't send him back sooner since the hotel is his home. Betty Jo doesn't take too kindly to their insinuation that Dog does not equally belong to her, especially as Dog's entry into the Bradley clan was when he followed Betty Jo home. The sisters' feud doesn't stop Dog from going where ever he wants, which means back to Betty Jo and Steve's. The feud escalates when Steve sides with Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo, and Sam, in an argument with Joe, sides with Betty Jo. Steve thinks he has the answer when he gets Betty Jo another dog, which ends up only compounding the problem. Dog, who can only take so much of the feuding, decides to show his extended family that the feuding has to stop in the only way he knows how.",

News of her visit quickly spreads among her former courters, including Uncle Joe, Sam and Ralph. They all believe that they can rekindle their respective courtships with Florabelle. Uncle Joe and Sam in particular feel that they are in competition for Florabelle's affections, and will do whatever they can to gain the upper hand in Florabelle's heart. Their perceptions and the reality of Florabelle's visit end up being two totally separate things.

Beyond the regular maintenance and cleaning duties, one of the administrative things that Uncle Joe believes needs to be done is to collect rent from their guests. Their only guest is 'Old Man' Bill Clayton, who Kate allowed to stay despite he having no money. Her implied want is for the family to treat him like a regular guest while she's gone. However, Uncle Joe has every intention on collecting his rent or kicking him out. Uncle Joe ultimately changes his mind, but Mr. Clayton sees the hotel bill in Joe's hand and decides voluntarily to leave. Thinking that he kicked Mr. Clayton out, the girls, Sam and Floyd treat Uncle Joe like he's persona non grata. Knowing that he did wrong, Uncle Joe decides to run away. He gets a little help in surviving on the road from a few unwitting people. When the girls and Steve find out where Uncle Joe's been hiding, they have to come up with a meaningful way to get him back to the Shady Rest.",

She is excited about her recording career potentially going through the roof, but is worried that she, as a personality, won't be exciting enough either for the press agent, Ted Swift, or the record buying public. Indeed, Swift is less than enthralled by life at the Shady Rest as a means to market Billie Jo. Eventually, Swift wants to market Billie Jo as a glamorous and sophisticated pampered southern belle, with the Shady Rest depicted as another Tara. To promote her career, Billie Jo likes the idea despite it being a total fabrication, which is why Steve and Betty Jo in particular hate the idea, especially since there is always the potential that the truth about her real life will be discovered. Betty Jo hopes that the question \"is this what Mom would want you to do?\" will make Billie Jo come to her senses, even if it risks her recording career.",

Cousin Mae's meddling quickly wreaks havoc for all concerned, from the hotel's relationship with Drucker's Store, to Steve and Betty Jo's remodeling plan for the cottage, to Bobbie Jo's love life with Jeff, to Billie Jo's singing career. In the middle of the \"Mae\" storm arrives sane and stable Aunt Helen, who is stopping by the Shady Rest to begin her world trip as she has now retired from teaching. As Helen too ends up a victim of Mae's meddling, she comes up with a plan to convince Mae that her time at the Shady Rest is at its end.",

A week Thursday, the Cannonball will go to the highest bidder, with one bid already having come in from a junk dealer who wants it for scrap. Bedloe further tells them that the sale is out of his hands as the C & FW Railroad has been sold to the H. Greene Company, who is behind the sale and who has fewer scruples than Bedloe himself. The people of the valley decide to try and raise money in whatever way they can to outbid the junk dealer, with Aunt Helen taking it upon herself to find out what that bid is. When they find out that bid is higher than what they can probably raise, Uncle Joe moves to Plan B: go to the top in Chicago and meet with the powerful H. Greene himself... or so Joe thinks.",

Joe is excited to be able to spend all this time with his best friend, he even thinking about putting an extra bed in his room so that they can bunk together. But what Joe doesn't account for is that Sam may have plans of his own. Even though Sam does plan on hanging out with Joe doing their guy stuff, Sam ends up spending most of his time helping Helen around the hotel. When Sam finds out on day four why Joe has been in such a foul mood, Sam tries to make it up to him all in one day, even if it kills both him and Joe.",

But what seems to be the hottest topic that everyone wants to talk about but won't is that Steve comes home not wearing his wedding ring. Betty Jo later learns that Steve was not not wearing his ring to \"play the field\" while at the convention, but rather took it off to get it engraved, which Betty Jo had been wanting him to do for some time. Based on this incident, they make a pact never to remove their wedding rings ever again. But when Betty Jo takes her ring off to show Bobbie Jo the engraved text in it, Betty Jo accidentally drops it down the kitchen sink drain. With her sisters' help, Betty Jo tries to dismantle the drain so that she can get her ring back all without Steve finding out, which is more difficult than she imagines. Things get even more complicated when she needs to call in professional help, but doesn't have the money to pay, leaving her to devise a plan worthy of Uncle Joe to get the work done without paying.",

    "description": "The people of Hooterville receive news that Kate is finally on her way home. That's when the arguments begin about where her official welcoming celebration will take place and who will preside over such an event. Mayor Potts wants to preside over it at a downtown location. Sam wants to preside over it outside his store. Selma wants to preside over it in her garden. And Joe wants to preside over it at the Shady Rest. With hours left before Kate's scheduled arrival, concurrent preparations are being made by each of the organizing parties, with the most important part of that organization being the plan to nab Kate to bring her to their locale. As they all wait for Kate's three o'clock arrival in front of Sam's store, unfortunately for Kate she has plans of her own unknown to her family and friends.",

Uncle Joe and his friends discuss names for the baby, which they want to sound strong and presidential, such as Joe Carson Elliott, Sam Drucker Elliott, or Newt Kiley Elliott. Steve throws Betty Jo and all the Bradleys for a loop when he announces that he has made arrangements with relatives in Baltimore for Betty Jo to stay there and have the baby delivered by one of the finest gynecologists in one of the finest hospitals in the country. While Betty Jo would rather stay in Hooterville and have the baby delivered by Doc Stuart in Hooterville Hospital, she is conflicted as she knows that Steve only wants what's best for her. While the Bradleys believe the decision is Steve and Betty Jo's to make, the townsfolk see Betty Jo leaving as a slight on the valley and as such they decide to snub Betty Jo and Steve. Will anything make Steve reconsider? Meanwhile, Wendell Gibbs, the new engineer of the Cannonball, is hoping people will start calling him \"Cannonball\".",

He loves them and wants to book them for the fall season opening show of the Omaha based Buddy Buster television program. After Sam shows him a photo of the girls, he is more convinced than ever and signs a contract with Uncle Joe for the girls' appearance. What Uncle Joe forgets until he talks to Kate and the girls about it is that Betty Jo's pregnancy is not exactly television friendly. Betty Jo's appearance also does not match the \"Singing Sweethearts\" name that Buddy Buster himself wants to use for the girls. When Ted sees Betty Jo, he knows that he is in a bit of a bind with days until the show, and Uncle Joe can't renege on the contract as he has already spent the advance. So they all collectively have to come up with a way to solve all their problems.",

That feeling is fostered by Betty Jo focusing on issues around the baby instead of focusing on his needs. That feeling is also fostered by others in the valley, who want solely to deal solely with Betty Jo in anything having to do with the baby. To get Steve out of feeling the way he is, Uncle Joe concocts a plan for himself and Steve to \"disappear\", with the expected result being that Betty Jo and the rest of the family will go out rushing to find them during this crucial time in Betty Jo's pregnancy.

Steve thinks that it a good idea if they move back to the Shady Rest until the baby comes. Wendell has been on an around the clock watch for the last week keeping the train engine stoked. This 24-hour a day watch is taking its toll on his body. Betty Jo is trying to hold off the baby's arrival as Billie Jo is out of town on a singing engagement, and is trying to make it back as soon as she can. But more importantly, Kate is out of town taking care of their ailing Aunt Ruth. When Betty Jo finally goes into labor, will Wendell be awake to get them to the hospital? And will both Billie Jo and Kate make it back in time?",

Part of that support is a doctor coming from Beverly Hills. Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo are hoping that the doctor is a young, handsome, eligible bachelor. So they are somewhat dismayed to learn that the doctor is a she and a distant relative, who is coming on the request of their mother based on the doctor's reputation alone. She ends up being Doctor Granny Clampett, who is not what one most would consider a traditional doctor despite her own assertions. When nearsighted Granny mistakes Dog for the baby, Granny prescribes a powerful homemade medicinal therapy to transform a dog-like baby to a baby-like baby. Dog takes the unfortunate brunt of Granny's therapy.",

Janet is as aware as anyone that her gender places her in an uphill battle in winning acceptance as a trusted physician in this rural area, with where she immediately falls in love. She didn't want to announce her gender before arriving in the probability that she would be refused before she even started. Indeed, those in the older generations are against a female doctor for several reasons. Even Betty Jo deep down has the same problem as most of the other wives of the valley of her husband going to see an attractive female doctor. Joe comes up with a plan to get rid of Dr. Craig from the valley. Will Janet buckle under the stress of Joe's plan?",

But Janet, who has every intention of staying in the valley which she loves, has ways of thawing the old freeze. Sam and Wendell quickly melt under Janet's defrosting machine. Joe, on the surface, is a slightly more difficult case, although he too is thawing under the ice veneer. When Joe sees that Sam and Wendell have gone over to the side of the lady doctor, will Joe still try to beat them or will he join them?",

She and Doc Stuart are splitting up the patients in the valley based on geography, meaning that Joe will have to go to her if he gets sick. His new plot is for someone to come up with a fake illness - something that she can't diagnose - which will lead to no one having any confidence in her abilities. After losing a lagging contest with Sam and Wendell, Joe himself is elected the patient with the mysterious illness. With heating pad and ice cubes in hand to mimic hot and cold spells on different parts of his body simultaneously, Joe enacts his plan. What Joe doesn't count on is that doctors talk to each other, they, who in combination, come up with a \"diagnosis and remedy\". What Joe also doesn't count on is that illnesses really do happen when you least expect them.",

It's because she knows he's here not only to rekindle their relationship, but to ask her to marry him, the answer about which she will have conflicting emotions regardless of if it's yes or no. If she says yes, it means she will be leaving the valley. No one wants to see Janet leave - not even Joe and Sam, who worked so hard to try and get her to leave originally - and will do anything to keep her in the valley. The one exception is Steve, who as sad as he would be to see her leave, feels the decision is hers and hers alone. Regardless, the others feel that the only way to keep Janet in the valley is to provide her and Dennis individually with what they are getting from the other, namely romance, but from a different source.",

Betty Jo reluctantly agrees but doesn't seem to be able to focus on anyone else but the thought of Kathy Jo during the dinner date. Meanwhile back at the hotel, Bobbie Jo is first called off on a date she forgot about, then Janet is called off on a medical emergency, leaving Uncle Joe alone to look after the baby. How much trouble can Joe get into taking care of Kathy Joe on his own? Plenty, when a friendly poker game, the editor of the Pixley newspaper and the sheriff are thrown into the mix.",

Sam and Joe believe he's out to get Wendell, who they believe will incriminate himself through his naivety, honesty and helpful manner at all cost, as much of that help isn't part of his railroad job and as the result of his actions often is at the expense of keeping on schedule. They ultimately learn that Bedloe is watching Wendell's performance to use as an excuse to scrap the Cannonball in favor of a bus service for the valley, which in turn would put the Shady Rest out of business as there is no road that goes by the hotel. Although Bedloe requires an impartial and reliable third party verification of his report (he is hoping to use Janet), Janet in turn comes up with an idea that no one else in the valley has ever thought about in dealing with Bedloe's mean ways. A cake sent to the Elliotts from Granny Clampett in Beverly Hills plays an unwitting but ultimately important part in Janet's plan.",

    "description": "Bobbie Jo is enthralled with a new book she is reading called \"The Feminine Mistake\" which has the basic premise that women are being denied their humanity by men by being forced into domestic lives rather than real careers. After speaking to Janet who she believes is a fully realized woman, Bobbie Jo decides to look for a job so that she can gain an identity through her work. Her first attempts at jobs end in disaster. In the process, a few people get hurt by Bobbie Jo's actions, however unintentional the results were. Will Bobbie Jo find her true calling in life and thus will she in turn find out who she really is as a person? If not, she may take drastic measures. It may take a case of reverse psychology to make Bobbie Jo fully understand her life in Hooterville. Meanwhile, Uncle Joe tries to build a motorized bicycle so that he doesn't have to pedal.",

In an effort to make it up to her, Steve professes his love to her. Betty Jo, in turn preoccupied with her chores, doesn't pay too much attention to Steve's professing his love. When Betty Jo learns from Bobbie Jo why Steve said what he did, Betty Jo feels that she has to make it up to him. But now with Steve preoccupied, Betty Jo really does feel like she's being ignored when she tries to profess her love for him. Despite Bobbie Jo's meddling getting them into the predicament they're currently in, Steve follows one last piece of advice from Bobbie Jo based on advice from worldly Lisa Douglas to Betty Jo earlier in the day.",

As such, they have only a few days to decide on who Kathy Jo's godparents will be. They also realize that whoever they don't choose will be hurt and offended. Although she says that her mentioning the issue was not supposed to be a plug for herself, Janet is honored that Betty Jo and Steve ask her to be godmother. Janet's counterpart is a different matter as Uncle Joe, Sam, Bert, Wendell and even Doc Stuart hope and believe they will be chosen godfather, many who will do whatever it takes to convince Steve and Betty Jo. Ultimately, Betty Jo and Steve believe that the godmother should have one extra duty.",

Billie Jo thinks that a good way for him to ingratiate himself into the hearts of the valley residents is for him to star in the Hooterville charity radio show (much to the chagrin of saxophonist Selma, who saw herself as the star of the show). Rick agrees, if only to please Billie Jo. Billie Jo wishes she could take back the invitation when she hears a part of Rick's routine for the show, which is a put-down of the valley and its residents. Billie Jo has to figure out how to get Rick from doing that routine, which would make her and Rick personae non gratae in valley.",

Steve has a hard time passing up the thought of the offer. Much to his surprise, Betty Jo, who has lived her entire life in the valley, doesn't object to the move, stating that she'll do whatever is best for Steve. However, without the other knowing, Steve and Betty Jo are both looking for an excuse not to go. Will they end up leaving despite neither really wanting to go? Meanwhile, as Steve has no use for his plane in New York, Uncle Joe tries to find someone he can push around to take over the \"Elliott\" portion of the Carson-Elliott Airlines, which means someone to fly the plane. Uncle Joe believes any sap could learn how to fly, except of course him when it comes right down to it.",

They have the books and the money, but now need a location. Janet suggests a mobile library in the form of the Cannonball. Sam, Bert and Uncle Joe, each wearing his Sunday best and with gift in hand, does whatever he can to spend time aboard the mobile library to be with Adelle to garner her favor. This competition for Adelle causes a rift between the three friends. But an unlikely person, who has greater access and a more similar mentality, may have the upper hand in attracting Adelle's attention.",

Janet's idea is to hold a musical tribute spanning time, with Billie Jo, Bobbie Jo and Betty Jo being the featured performers. Selma, whose husband's great great uncle Cyrus Plout founded Hooterville, hates the idea - especially the mini-skirt wearing number for the current period - as she doesn't think it's dignified enough for the memory of one of her family members. After she berates the girls, Uncle Joe kicks Selma out. Beyond Selma yelling at the girls, Uncle Joe actually agrees with her beliefs about such a number ruining Founder's Day, and he too takes up the argument where Selma left off. Uncle Joe believes his thoughts are paramount since the Royal Order of the Camels - his lodge - is hosting this year's celebrations. Somehow, the Bradley clan and the older and younger generations are going to have to figure out a way both to get over their feud and decide who has what say in how the celebrations are going to function. Henrietta Plout may unwittingly come up with an issue that breaks the stalemate.",

    "description": "After Sam makes some major (in reality, not so major) renovations and introduces some streamlined processes to the post office, he learns from the government that they are planning on shutting down his postal substation. The Bradleys, led by Uncle Joe, scheme on ways to make the government change their minds and keep the Hooterville substation open. Their plan is to encourage all the valley residents to mail themselves preferably parcels, but also letters, to show that there is a need and demand by the valley for that substation to remain open. The residents agree, so much so that Sam has no time to run the store as he is dealing solely with the mail. Uncle Joe takes a photograph of the overloaded post office, with the intention of going to Washington D.C. to show the photograph to his local congressman for his support in the matter. Janet and Bobbie Joe tag along to Washington for moral support. Getting to see the congressman is a difficult task, so the threesome take a tour of the city while they wait for their appointment. At the Lincoln Memorial, Uncle Joe gives a moving and heartfelt recitation of the Gettysburg address, which touches all those who hear him. He even inspires himself, and show such by tearing up the fraudulent photograph and deciding to argue for the post office on its own merits. On the way back to the congressman's office, they walk by the White House and notice a dog stuck in the fence's grating. Uncle Joe helps the dog out from his fence prison, the dog grateful to Uncle Joe. A certain person sees this good deed, that person being President Nixon, who comes out personally to thank Uncle Joe. Back at Hooterville, Uncle Joe tells Sam that he is certain that his new friend \"Dick\" will pull some strings to keep the post office open. However Sam has some surprising news of his own for Uncle Joe: the day Uncle Joe left for Washington, Sam received further notification that the government sent him the initial notification in error, and that it is the Hunterville, not Hooterville, post office that is scheduled for closure.",

Janet figures Kathy Jo was allergic to something that is no longer in her environment. But Kathy Jo's rash reappears when Steve returns from a week long business trip. As Janet doesn't know to what Kathy Jo is allergic, Steve states that they should try to use some deductive reasoning to figure out the culprit. Unfortunately for Steve, the biggest change to when Kathy Jo does and does not have the rash is him. While Janet consults with Dr. Nicholson, an allergist colleague of hers, she suggests an experiment of Steve moving out of the house to see if the rash clears once again while he's away. It does. While they all collectively wait for news from Dr. Nicholson, Steve and Betty Jo have to combat one other issue: the rumor spreading through the valley that the two have separated.",

He announces the reason: he is going into retirement. That news shocks everyone as they all figured he was already retired. Uncle Joe learns that his big news has made him the laughing stock of the valley as everyone is talking about what a big deal he's made of retiring from nothing to doing what he always does: fish, play checkers and take naps. Feeling unappreciated, Uncle Joe decides to run away. When Janet finds out he's leaving, he lies that the reason is that he is off to do all those things he's wanted to do but couldn't before his retirement. Knowing that he is lying, Janet has to rally the residents of the valley to make Uncle Joe feel like he's a wanted and needed member of society. The plan make take a misstep as Uncle Joe tries to apply a little of his own form of retribution. So they may have to resort to Plan B.",

The valley residents soon blindly follow Freddie in whatever he suggests and trusts him with their money. But Freddie is not all that he appears, as his company plans to abscond with the money while leaving the church with an inferior second hand organ worth $20. As all the residents of the valley continually thank Freddie for his hard and noble work, will guilt get the better of him, and even if so will he be able to do the right thing with his boss Marco still wanting to pull the scam?",

As such, he proposes to set up a jitney service between Pixley and Hooterville as an alternative to the Cannonball. He bets Joe and the Cannonball to a race from Pixley to Hooterville, the loser to act as the bellboy at the other's hotel for a month. In addition, Hank convinces the county commissioner that the Cannonball's fate should depend on the outcome of the race. If the Cannonball ceases to operate, that means that the Shady Rest goes out of business. Part of Joe's problem in winning the race is getting Wendell into fighting mentality, rather than be his usual helpful self at the expense of speed in operating the train. But both Hank and Joe figure that some unconventional operating tactics and some sabotage are fair game all in the name of battle to the death of the jitney or the Cannonball.",

The trip reinforced how much she missed the field of neurology, in which she was originally going to specialize before she decided on general practice. The news hits everyone especially in the Bradley clan pretty hard and they vow to do whatever it takes to convince her to stay. They are hoping that the handsome Ted Thorsen, the forest ranger who has just injured his ankle, may provide that romantic impetus for Janet to stay. Their cause is helped by the fact of Ted staying at the Shady Rest during his recuperation period. Joe tries to help matters along not on the romantic side of things, but trying to make Ted's injury worse than it really is so that Janet will feel compelled to stay to take care of her new patient. But an act of nature may ultimately be the deciding factor.",

    "description": "Steve is working late into the night to submit a bit for a lucrative government contract. When Uncle Joe finds out about the contract after Steve has submitted his bid, Uncle Joe chastises him for not using Joe's administrative skills in greasing the process to ensure that Steve wins the contract. When Steve continues not to hear if he was awarded the contract, Joe can't help but continue to rub it into Steve that he should have consulted with him first. An angry Steve in turn blows up at Uncle Joe, dissolving the Carson-Elliott Airlines. After Steve hears if he was awarded the contract, one half of the old company is willing to bury the hatchet, but the other half isn't. It isn't until Steve hears from a government official named William R. Blake - an old Air Force nemesis of Steve's, who he refers to mockingly as \"By the Book Blake\" - that both Steve and Uncle Joe figure that neither knows everything that one needs to know about running the company effectively. Meanwhile, Bobbie Jo tries to get Uncle Joe to start running as a form of exercise.",

Dog begins to feel left out, especially as he tries to partake in the same activities as Kathy Jo or tries to help in her care, which results in him being chastised for getting in Kathy Jo's way. Now feeling unloved at the Shady Rest, Dog decides to run away. Dog is wrong about being unloved as when the gang at the Shady Rest realize that he is missing, they are frantic in their search for him, especially as a thunderstorm rolls through the valley. Janet is the first to understand why he ran away. Their search for Dog may be a difficult one as he tries to stay at least one step ahead of them while avoiding any potential perceived dangers. An objective third party may provide Dog with a slightly clearer perspective on his lot in life.",

On a technicality, Orrin Pike, the new game warden in the area, has issued a ticket to Uncle Joe for being over the catch limit (despite being over the limit only since he had Sam's fish as well). Orrin also happens to be who Bobbie Jo sees as her potential new boyfriend. Uncle Joe tries to figure out a way to get out of the ticket and the resulting court appearance through killing Orrin with kindness, however to no avail. To win, Joe even asks many of his friends to vouch for his character and trustworthiness - ostensibly to lie for him under oath. When all else seems hopeless, Bobbie Jo takes over, trying to balance her want for Uncle Joe to get off while maintaining a personal relationship with Orrin. Perhaps another technicality will save the day.",

Even the Shady Rest has lost Martha, one of its prized chickens. Orrin is under a lot of pressure to solve the case. But without results, Orrin is demoted since he came across the poachers, knew they were the poachers but let them get away. His demotion is also partly due to an anonymous telephone call (from Uncle Joe) to Orrin's boss stating that Orrin couldn't find a bear trapped in a telephone booth. Because of this, Orrin is more determined than ever to nab the poachers to regain his job. He needs some assistance and Bobbie Jo and Janet pressure Uncle Joe into being that assistant. But yet another error on Orrin's part results in him and Uncle Joe not being able to get very far in their search. Regardless, the poachers stumble across the twosome. But before the poachers can leave the valley for good, Orrin's error comes in handy to stop the poachers from being able to leave.",

As incentive, the grand prize is a trip to Los Angeles. Steve encourages Orrin to earn brownie points with Bobbie Jo by entering her in the contest. Betty Jo is angry that Steve didn't think of her for the contest. And originally unknown to Steve and Orrin, Uncle Jo enters Billie Jo in the contest, she who is a little embarrassed by being entered by her uncle instead of a beau but who is nonetheless grateful. Steve sees that having all three sisters entered in the contest will lead to nothing but trouble, especially as a Bradley is bound to win. Although it doesn't start out that way, he ends up being right, with each girl and her nominator not speaking to the enemy camps. Sam complicates matters by submitting his own entry. On the day of the contest, Janet thinks she might have the answer to all their problems.",

His biggest fan, Bobbie Jo, is excited that he, now out of the military, is coming to Hooterville to perform and is staying at the Shady Rest. Other than Bobbie Jo, one other person in Hooterville that actually knows of Glen is Janet. She is a member of the International Adoption Agency, which suspects that someone in his army unit that was recently discharged abducted a little four year old orphaned girl named Tami Kwong from the adoption center in Da Nang, Vietnam. Glen states that he knows nothing of Tami's whereabouts. But what Uncle Joe, Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo soon find out is that Glen has Tami stashed in his duffel bag. It is obvious that the two want to be together, but that Glen would not be considered suitable parental material by the adoption agency. The Bradleys may be willing to assist Glen in keeping Tami a secret from the authorities, but will Janet, if she finds out, be as accommodating?",

The reason for her choosing the Shady Rest gets Steve into some trouble. He met her the previous year when she visited the air force base where he was doing some reserve training. He, who acted as her base escort, recommended the hotel to her. To the Bradleys, Jackie seems like the type of woman who would have done whatever Steve wanted and more. Despite Steve vowing that he did nothing to encourage Jackie, she still fawns over him. As such, the Bradley sisters do whatever they can to slyly encourage her to leave for the sake of Steve and Betty Jo's marriage. Uncle Joe unwittingly thwarts their plans and makes her want to stay longer. But Billie Jo comes up with another plan of her own, using a little of Jackie's own devices.",

To prevent a flu outbreak, she plans on providing a free shot to every single person in the valley. Beyond getting her novice nurses accustomed to poking a needle into real human flesh, Janet may have some problems from needle phobic patients, such as Uncle Joe. But they manage to inoculate every single person in the valley except the back woods Tweedy family, led by the family patriarch Jasper Tweedy, who speaks less with his mouth and more with his shotgun. Janet is concerned as the multitude of Tweedy children alone could start an outbreak of the flu. Janet tries to reason with him, use an old checkers playing friend (Uncle Joe) to soften him up, have her pretty nurses cozy up to his eldest son, Claude Tweedy, and use the perception of authority (Orrin) to force him. But their best line of attack in getting the Tweedys immunized may be Jasper's dog, Gus.",

    "description": "Based on a misunderstanding with Uncle Joe specifically about the use of the bathroom they share, Steve thinks that it's time for him and Betty Jo to move out of the hotel to preserve Bradley family harmony. Although Mr. Haney hasn't been too successful in selling their cottage, they speak to him about other his other listings they may be interested in buying. They come to understand why he isn't such a successful real estate agent. Meanwhile back at the hotel, everyone, including Uncle Joe, are sorry that Steve and Betty Jo want to move. While Billie Jo and Janet feel that it really is Steve and Betty Jo's decision without their meddling, Uncle Joe and Bobbie Jo want to do something to make Steve and Betty Jo change their minds. Uncle Joe thinks he has the perfect idea: build another bathroom in the hotel for Steve and Betty Jo. The ease or success of carrying out Uncle Joe's plan is another matter.",

Bobbie Jo talks Orrin into coming along this year much to Uncle Joe's dismay, not only because he still sees Orrin as a bumbling fool and nemesis but because he learns that Bobbie Jo, using this camping trip as a ploy to \"work on\" Orrin, wants to eventually marry him. Janet thinks this trip will end up being a good opportunity for Orrin to get on Uncle Joe's good side by demonstrating his abilities in his element, the great outdoors. Despite Orrin's best attempts to win over Uncle Joe, Uncle Joe takes an antagonistic attitude toward anything Orrin says or does. The capper for Uncle Joe is when Orrin runs off in a moment of crisis. But does Orrin's seemingly cowardly behavior have a greater motive?",

Billie Jo, who is out of town on a singing engagement, was planning on making it back in time for the party, but she may have to decide if the party or her career is more important when her singing engagement is held over. Janet and her nursing assistant Bobbie Jo are called off on a medical emergency which ends up being a little more plentiful than they first thought. Sam has a last minute court case where he has to perform his justice of the peace duties which involves an uncooperative defendant. Steve is called back to redo a recently completed job where insects are infesting the crop. And Uncle Joe has taken Kathy Jo into Pixley to buy her whatever she wants for her birthday present. That gift ends up causing a bit of an issue in town which delays Uncle Joe and Kathy Jo indefinitely. So when the party rolls around, will anyone be there besides Betty Jo and Dog?",

Bradley Memorial Suite, he who was the girls' great-great-grandfather and founder of the Shady Rest - Uncle Joe comes to the realization that in one week's time it will be the seventy-fifth anniversary of the completion by said Mallard P. Bradley of the railroad between Hooterville and Pixley. He feels there should be a special community ceremony marking the anniversary. The problem ends up being that although he invites representatives from both Pixley and Hooterville to be present at the ceremony, Uncle Joe wants all the glory moments of the ceremony for himself. The most contentious of those ceremony events is the driving of the golden spike, which all the community leaders want to do. Bobbie Jo ultimately comes up with the compromise candidate that everyone can agree on, especially since he was at the driving of the original last spike: Grandpa Miller. The choice of Grandpa Miller has its own challenges, specifically whether he can both physically and mentally handle the job. At a practice ceremony, an incident promises to change the face of the valley forever - well, at least for 2 hours and 23 minutes.",

    "description": "Sam is excited that the first ever registered letter has come through his post office, in this case for Joe. Joe is nervous when he learns that it is from a law firm, and even more nervous when he reads the letter: that their client, a Mr. Herbert A. Smith - who Joe doesn't know - has been looking for him, and will know that Joe is indeed that person if the registered letter gets to him. When Smith arrives, Joe still doesn't know who he is or remember ever meeting him. But Smith tells Joe a story of a kind favor he did for him twenty years earlier in Erie, Pennsylvania when he was down and out. That favor was the start of his redemption. Smith, now seemingly wealthy, wants to repay that favor. Joe isn't too sure about Smith after he tells a further story of his business conglomerate, which has just issued public offerings. Joe thinks Smith may try and swindle him into investing in the ground floor of this fake business venture. But Smith irks Joe even more when he says the shares are all accounted for, which means that he isn't going to provide Joe any shares, free or otherwise. Joe ultimately settles on his assessment of Smith and tries to get the best deal for himself. However, Joe finally remembers back to twenty year earlier, which may make him think he made the biggest mistake of his life.",

Based on a discussion Bobbie Jo had with Billie Jo on the telephone, she's sure that Billie Jo thinks that Jerry may be the one, and as such everyone wants to make a good impression on Jerry, showing him that they are all friendly and loving and thus would be a good family in to which to marry. Additionally, Billie Jo tells Jerry before their arrival in Hooterville that everyone is down to earth, and that they all get along. By the time Billie Jo and Jerry arrive, Uncle Joe and Sam are fighting, and Steve and Betty Jo, while putting on the face of the loving married couple to give Jerry ideas, too are feuding. And Bobbie Jo's overt efforts to push Billie Jo and Jerry together has an unexpected side effect. Billie Jo has mixed emotions about what her family is doing, and has to decide how best to make Jerry see what she really wants him to see of her family. But Jerry may thoughts of his own regardless.",

Those at the Shady Rest later learn that he is Ronnie Coleman, a helicopter pilot who Selma brought to the valley to set up a rival crop dusting business to Steve's, all in an effort to nab him as a husband for Henrietta. Despite knowing that he can't compete with Ronnie on a technological level, Steve harbors no ill will against Ronnie, but Uncle Joe does. Uncle Joe, with a little help from Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo, tries to devise a plan to get rid of Ronnie to save Steve's business. But Janet ultimately makes them aware that their plan has a hurtful consequence for an innocent third party. As such, Billie and Jo and Bobbie Jo decide to help Selma indirectly, which in turn has an unexpected consequence.",

They are surprised as Orrin had told Bobbie Jo that he couldn't even contemplate getting married until he got at least one more pay raise. They can't wait to get back to the hotel to tell Billie Jo and Uncle Joe, the latter who has a less than enthusiastic response to Bobbie Jo possibly marrying Orrin. Keeping the secret from Bobbie Jo may be an issue. Later, Orrin comes by the hotel with news of his own: he got the raise that he wanted, and wants to celebrate with the entire family. The family minus Bobbie Jo put two and two together and come to the conclusion that the party night is when he will propose. Meanwhile, burly farmer Merlin Fergus comes into town looking for a wife. Uncle Joe thinks his prayers have been answered as he tries to match Merlin and Bobbie Jo together. Merlin, Bobbie Jo and Orrin may have some say in Uncle Joe's plan, but Orrin's statement isn't quite what they were all expecting.",

Among the family heirlooms that Orrin gives to the Bradley family as farewell gifts, Janet finds a document - a deed - which makes Orrin the owner of the entire valley. With explanations from Mayor Potts and Sam, Uncle Joe has a new appreciation of Orrin who can control what happens in the valley. It takes some time for Orrin to get accustomed to his new-found status of king of the valley - with Bobbie Jo as his potential queen - but he ultimately lets it go to his head. Further news from Janet about the deed and resulting advice from her makes Orrin take some action which could again change Uncle Joe's perception of Orrin for good.",

Everyone at the hotel is excited about his visit except Steve, who says that his Uncle George is a great, charming fellow but who ends up always causing trouble by something he says or does, or just the fact of him being around. What's worse in Steve's mind is that Uncle George has no idea he is the cause of any of the commotion. Betty Jo initially has no idea to what Steve is referring as she sees nothing in Uncle George but a charming, suave man. True to Steve's word, everyone starts fighting with everyone else, with Uncle George calmly there but on the sidelines. After argument after argument, Steve decides to restore peace and order at the Shady Rest, but someone else beats him to the punch.",

She returns home with a new attitude - that of the emancipated woman, equal to any man - and a new attire of a man's suit to match. She feels that women are repressed in society and need to fight back. Steve and Uncle Joe believe Billie Jo's new outlook is hogwash, whereas Janet, Bobbie Jo and Betty Jo agree with parts of it, but not its entirety. They all find out that her attitude is in part due to a disagreement with Jerry. Billie Jo soldiers on, with her attitude causing both collective and individual arguments between men and women in the valley. Only one person may ultimately make Billie Jo modify her extreme view.",

Everyone soon learns that he is with the Highway Commission, which is planning on constructing a new road through the valley. He is there to determine its route. Steve gets Joe on the idea that there might be some land speculation based on figuring out that new route. As such, Joe, wanting in on the action, decides to try and convince all the residents of the valley to allow him to act on their behalf to get the best deal. That way, Joe will get a commission no matter where the road goes. Joe's idea doesn't quite catch the imagination of most residents. What seems to be a certainty is that the road will go through Steve and Betty Jo's property, which means that they will finally be able to unload the property and move on with their lives. But Betty Jo comes to the realization that that also means their honeymoon cottage will be torn down. Uncle Joe, who is \"helping\" them with the land deal, may also have something to say about the matter.",

Although Janet can't find anything medically wrong with her, Selma feigns whiplash and a back injury which requires her to be bedridden. As Henrietta is away, the girls and Janet suggest she stay at the hotel while she recuperates. Selma is not only a demanding unpaid guest, but it looks as if she is planning on suing, which could mean the girls losing the hotel. Consulting a lawyer - the wrong lawyer - could mean even worse news for Joe. Only a miracle, or perhaps the truth, could save Joe and the girls from losing the hotel.",

Having only limited experience doing the job, Joe volunteers regardless. Joe decides to make some changes, most specifically having a rigid schedule that only makes pick-ups and drop-offs at designated stops, which is not the way most of the people in the valley operate. In turn, what that means is that Joe often runs the train without any passengers, much to the anger of the many people who missed the train or who Joe wouldn't pick-up. That may be the least of the problems as a Mr. Bellingham, a representative of the C & FW Railroad, has come to inform the people of the valley that Floyd's retirement also means the retirement of the Cannonball. The only way to save the Cannonball is to find the missing documentation that lays out the agreement between the railroad and the people of the valley as to the Cannonball's operation. While they look, everyone reminisces about what the Cannonball has meant to the people of the valley.",

Most of the men at the Shady Rest believe Billie Jo's idea, about which she is extremely passionate, is just her latest weirdo fad. Those views place a strain especially between Steve and Betty Jo, and Orrin and Bobbie Jo. The men don't want this issue to be the cause of any tension so they try and come up with a way to diffuse the issue. Beyond their plan, Janet ends up being the voice of reason.",

While Uncle Joe and his band of friends speculate on who the lucky man from town is, Janet confesses directly to the girls and Steve that the man in question is Dr. Peter Marlow, an old beau from her medical school days. Peter is coming to Hooterville to visit Janet, many thinking that Peter is coming to stay and ask Janet to marry him. They are half correct: Peter has indeed come to ask for Janet's hand, but rather than stay in Hooterville, Peter wants to whisk Janet away to his home base of Hawaii. The Bradley's initial excitement turns to panic as they think they may lose Janet. The girls' try and break Janet and Peter up - Bobbie Jo is the only one who volunteers for the task, but is unsuccessful. Then Betty Jo and Steve think that Kathie Jo may be able to sway Janet. Janet is torn between her love for Peter and her love for the lifestyle of Hooterville. As the Bradley girls finally decide to let Janet make up her own mind without prejudice, Janet does eventually make up her mind based on where her heart truly lies.",

    "description": "Steve can't sleep as he's worried about the family finances. The crop dusting business is doing well enough, but all his customers are requesting credit while his suppliers are demanding payment. He doesn't want to be heavy handed with his customers since they are all long time friends of the Bradley family and he doesn't want to create an air of conflict within the valley. Betty Jo initially tells Steve to demand payment from his customers, but changes her mind when she thinks about the personal situations of all those individuals. Even though she knows for a fact that Steve would be against the idea, Betty Jo thinks that the best way to solve their financial problem is for her to get a job. Since she's looking after Kathy Jo anyway, she figures the perfect job would be to open a daycare at the hotel. She decides not to tell Steve about this plan. On the first day, Betty Jo, with the help of her sisters, does booming business and the children under her care all seem happy. But when Steve comes home unexpectedly, Bobbie Jo quickly hides all evidence of extra babies, including the babies themselves. Steve knows that something isn't quite right as one after one pieces of evidence do arise. Steve eventually does find out about the daycare, but an extraordinary act by Kathy Jo may ultimately save her mother.",
