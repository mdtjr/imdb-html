    "description": "Faith is thrilled when Hannah declares that she will be moving in with Nick and asks Paul round for sex but he is off to Newcastle for a job interview. Sympathetic work colleague Jill asks Faith to a dinner party where she is introduced to Steven,a man who rescues her from Jill's drunken husband Mike and suggests a date though Faith is put off by his being a fervent Christian. Her independence is short-lived when a tearful Hannah returns,after a girl with whom Nick was clearly more than friends arrives from Australia. So,when Paul rings to say that he is back from Newcastle and free Faith has to say Thanks But No Thanks.",
