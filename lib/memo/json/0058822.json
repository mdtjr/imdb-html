    "description": "William Colton rides into a town one month after Appomatox. Inside, there is a young man, not much more than a boy, who is talking really tough. An old man fresh out of a prison camp is there as well. The old man, Ab Nichols, fought for the Confederacy, and is offended when the young drunk, Jody Merriman, desecrates the Confederate flag. That's when Colton gets involved. As he fights for this man's honor, he remembers back to the last day of the Civil War and another young man he came face-to-face with.",

Some time earlier, the Townsends' had found some virgin soil outside of town and offered to pay McComb for it. McCaomb refused, and the quakers settled the land and began homesteading. McComb demanded they get off their land. He had threatened all sorts of things against them if they didn't. This particular day, he made his threats again. Townsend Sr. went to Colton's hotel room and asked him to kill McComb for them since it was against their religion to perform the act of violence themselves; but they soon came back to their senses. Townsend decided it would be best to leave.",

Harry asked Colton to go with him to meet the stage and tell the widow. But a surprise was waiting for them there. It turns out that Joe Sullivan had married an Indian, and Harry wanted nothing to do with him. He spat out that Joe was dead, and ordered her to leave at once. Colton put Sue up in his hotel room until he could send her away the following day. But something else happened that evening. An Apache Indian boy was captured. The men planned to torture him before killing him. Colton decided that he had to try and get Sue out of there, because she could be next. But was it already too late?",

The boy immediately takes to him, excited that Colton was in the war and went to West Point with his father. Colton learns that Mrs. Wayne has gone against guns and the war, and strictly prohibits him to talk about these things to her young son. Colton agrees to respect her wishes, but believes it's a mistake. Then when he goes into town, he runs into the hot-shot rancher who killed Abner out of lust for wife. Trouble is brewing, especially when Gibson learns Colton is now staying at the Wayne house as her guest.",

He was told that about ten men came to his father's house, dragged him to town, abused him, then lynched him. They planned on leaving his body hanging in the tree until the following day.

He had a ring from his great-great grandfather. In New York, a man said, \"Go West.\" Then he bought Hyman's ring for $400.00. Colton is happy for him. It looks like Hyman has found a home. Before Colton leaves him, Hyman declares, \"You know something? I LOVE America!\" But soon he learns about another side of America. A tin horn poker player is in town. His name is Charlie Parker and he informs Hyman that the shoemaker's shop would cost him $800. It's a trick, of course, and Hyman falls for it. He puts all his life's savings in the pot.",

Colton thinks his illness is serious, and when he finds out a doctor is upstairs he goes to speak to the doctor. The doctor turns out to be a bitter surgeon who lost his hand when his horse spooked, causing a wagon accident and his hand to be severed by the wheel of a train. Colton delivers a fiery speech and begs the doctor to come look, though the doctor had already given his diagnosis: Appendicitas. Then Colton comes up with an idea: He'll do the surgery if the doctor will tell him what to do. Did he pull it off?",

When Colton announced he was on his way to town to look for work, the sheriff told him he had a job: $5 a day to look for Siedry. Colton made it clear that he didn't ride on a posse where men planned on killing the wanted man. The sheriff said he wanted the man brought in alive, but Colton wondered if that's what Shaftoe wanted. That evening, he began to understand that Shaftoe may indeed have reasons to kill his childhood friend.",

Soon, Colton learned that the man who wrote the letter was one of his old privates named Andrew Drake. Drake had been a coward and placed some of his articles on a dead man. Colton believed the dead man to be Drake. Drake explained that he was ready to turn himself in at Saint Thomas, where his father, a Sergeant, was now stationed. But it seems three men were after him, and getting him out of town would be difficult.",

He finally gave in, and discovered that she was also taking something else with her - a small elm tree.

A man by the name of Matthew Reynolds had just been released from prison, and the Reverend is afraid he is on his way to kill him. But after talking to the Reverend in person, Colton learns the real reason for the letter: Reverend Whatley wants to hire him to kill Reynolds, and he's willing to pay a thousand dollars for the job. Of course Colton turns down the generous offer so the Reverend orders one of his men to do the job. Colton sets out to do his sworn duty to protect any and all who need protection, and he learns the truth about Reynolds.",
