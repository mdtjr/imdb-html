    "description": "Jess Harper has drifted into Laramie, Wyoming Territory from Texas looking for the \"friend\" who stole his money. He gets a cold reception from the lawmen of Laramie when he's mistaken for a member of Bud Carlin's gang, out to spring one of their own from jail. Jess receives an even chillier reception from Slim Sherman co-owner of Sherman Ranch. Slim's kid brother Andy takes a shine to the stranger when Jess finds himself at the Sherman Relay Station on the Central Overland Mail stage Line. Slim's dislike of Jess intensifies when Andy makes it plain he'd rather partner with the drifter than his own brother. Slim and Jess are forced into an uneasy partnership when Bud Carlin shows up at the relay station and takes them hostage to impersonate the judge who is on his way to Laramie to try Pete Morgan, the \"friend\" Jess Harper has been looking for.",

Roany Bishop is a down on his luck drifter who needs a way to Laramie to look up his friend Jess Harper. Roany claims to play the piano so that Miss Essie will take him Laramie. One their way they stop at the Sherman relay station. Jess, recognizes Roany and tries to avoid meeting up with him, to no avail. Roany presses Jess to go to Laramie with him using the fact the he'd save Jess's life several years prior. Meanwhile Jonesy, spying the piano tied to the back of Miss Essie's wagon, starts to play. Miss Essie invites Jonesy to play for her Sunday meeting and Jess ends up leaving Sherman Ranch to join up with Roany and Miss Essie. On the way, Roany ends up racing the stage bound for Laramie with near disastrous results. Once in town Roany starts revealing the darker side of his nature, which Jess figured all along. Roany eventually shows his true side during Sunday morning service with Miss Essie forcing a showdown with Jess.",

    "description": "When the Great Central Overland Mail stage breaks down on it's way to Laramie, it is an ill wind that blows. While the passengers are trying to effect repairs, Martha Chambers shoots and mortally wounds Taka, son of Pawnee Chief Yellow Knife, by mistake. Taking the wounded Indian with them, under the protestations of some of the passengers, the crippled coach manages to make it to the Sherman Relay station, putting Slim, Andy, Jess and Jonesy at risk. Fearing an attack by Yellow Knife and the Pawnee, Slim orders Jonesy and Andy to Laramie while Major David Prescott tries to save Taka's life. When Maj. Prescott's identity is revealed and the fact he was dishonorably discharged for conduct unbecoming an officer for taking up with a married woman, Martha Chambers. The relay station defenders manage to repulse the opening attack by the Pawnee but it's readily apparent to Slim, Jess and Maj. Prescott that they need help. Slim volunteers to ride for the cavalry platoon that had visited early that day but Jess takes the job, having had experience as a dispatch rider. After Jess leaves Slim and Prescott parley with Yellow Knife, hoping to avert a bloodbath, but Taka has died and Yellow Knife demands the body of his and the person who pulled the trigger but Prescott refuses to give up Martha and it starts a long night of waiting. Eventually Martha decides to give herself up to the Pawnee rather than see anyone at the relay station killed but she is thwarted by Andy and Slim. Slim decides to trick Yellow Knife into another parley, hoping to kill the chief and demoralize his men. Maj. Prescott has other ideas and cold cocks Slim to kill Yellow Knife himself. Slim regains consciousness in time to follow Prescott into the hills where the Pawnee have encircled the relay station. Major Prescott is killed by Yellow Knife and Slim ends up killing Yellow Knife.",

The problem is he doesn't know exactly where it is and needs a guide to help him find it. An investigator from the Adjutant General of the Army has been been following Cade since his release from prison, hoping that he will lead him to the money. When Cade gets thrown in jail for being very drunk and somewhat disorderly, the investigator approaches the sheriff about Cade. The sheriff suggests Slim Sherman to pose as a guide but it's decided that Slim is too well known to pull it off so Jess Harper agrees to masquerade as a down on his luck guide for Cade. So begins a journey that finds Jess slowly outnumbered as men from Chawcktaw's gang join the ranks, each carrying a piece of the route and each fearing the rest as they reveal their piece of the route to the money. The men are slowly being picked off as the danger to Jess grows until the final showdown between Cade and Chawcktaw over the money.",

She despises her marriage and dallies with almost any man, using them and then discarding them. When she runs from her husband she runs into the arms of Jess Harper, a man with whom she has a history with. Jess isn't happy to see her but finds himself believing her lies. He agrees to take her to Tumavaca and Slim Sherman isn't happy about Jess leaving, but can't stop him. There is an added complication, Arnold Dewalt has put bounty hunters on Laurel's trail and they aren't picky about who gets hurt as they trail their quarry. The road to Tumavaca holds more than one peril for Jess Harper.",

Whit gets Slim drunk reminiscing about old time and also gets him to agree to taking Andy up to his ranch in Montana for some fishing. In the sobering light of the next day, Slim reneges on taking Andy and Whit is force to reveal that he is allied with one Colonel Brandt who is out to assassinate General William Tecumseh Sherman. General Sherman is expected at the relay station that day. Jess Harper is also expected to return to the ranch from a trip out of town. When Jess arrives Jonesy plays like Jess is a stranger and he picks up immediately that something isn't right at the relay station, playing along with Jonesy. After Jess heads into Laramie does Whit figure out that the stranger was Jess and chases after him. Jess rides into an ambush on the road into Laramie and takes a fake fall off his horse. The attackers take no chances and shoot Jess, this time hitting him. Wounded and too far from town to make it on foot, Jess returns to the ranch. He manages to get the attention of Slim and they hatch a desperate plan to warn the Secret Service that the relay station is a trap. The plan is discovered and so is Jess Harper. With time running out Slim and Jess have to stop Colonel Brandt, Whit and the other killers from carrying out their plan to kill General Sherman.",

The problem is John MacLean was an innocent man and Jess was looking for the real murderer while Slim Sherman tried to stop the trial being held at Sherman ranch. When Jess gets back to the ranch with the real murderer he finds John MacLean dangling from a tree and Slim nursing a head wound. Jess is enraged at all the men who participated in the kangaroo court, including Judge Matthew Hedrick and his son Jim. His desire for justice for MacLean may cost him his friendship with Slim and possibly his freedom when the men responsible are found guilty but without criminal intent and set free.",

The stage line is suffering and there seems no end when Father Elliot comes to Sherman Ranch and Relay station on his way to the Yellowstone to meet with Sitting Bull. He needs a guide but both Jess Harper and Slim Sherman decline the job and the Army is set against Father Elliot making an all ready volatile situation worse. The gunrunners don't want him in the way either. Father Elliot, seeing it as a mission from God, ignores all and hires Charlie Root to guide him and sets off, passing again Sherman Ranch to say goodbye. When Jess and Jonesy find out that Charlie Root is wanted for murder, Jess has a difficult decision to make with Slim gone to Laramie on stage business. Stay at the ranch with Jonesy and Andy or go after Father Elliot and Charlie Root. Jonesy ends up forcing Jess to light out after Father Elliot. In the meantime, the good father has growing suspicions about Charlie Root and realizes his life is in danger. When Charlie Root's attempt to murder him backfires, Father Elliot is now on his own to make it to Yellowstone and Sitting Bull. Jess catches up with him in time to save in a fall off a precipice and continues on with Father Elliot. They come across the gunrunners readying to make a deal with Sitting Bull for repeating rifles and ammunition only to be foiled by a determined Father Elliot and an equally determined Jess Harper. After destroying the guns and ammunition, Father Elliot must now face Sitting Bull.",

Jonesy attempts to intervene with disastrous results when Farrell's desire for revenge is turned on Slim. Ed Farrell is also a man on the run, an escapee from Yuma Prison, with a price on his head. When Jonesy fails to stop Ed a second time, it lands him in jail in Casper and puts Farrell on the first stage to Laramie and the Sherman Ranch and Relay station. He gives Slim and Jess Harper a fake name and lands a job. Ed now has the opportunity to kill Slim but fate keeps intervening. When Jess finds out that their new ranch hand is Ed Farrell it's a race against time to save Slim from almost certain death.",

    "description": "John MacCambridge is the former marshal of Dodge City and a friend of Slim Sherman. He arrives in Laramie at the same time that Slim is seeing Jess Harper off on a cattle drive with the combined herds of several area ranches. MacCambridge is in town to buy a particular piece of land from Slim, supposedly to become a rancher. Slim refuses to sell the land but does agree to lease the land to MacCambridge. What MacCambridge doesn't tell Slim is that his partners in the ranch are some of the outlaws and gunmen that he's dealt with over the years. The situation in Laramie becomes volatile as, one by one, Mac's partners arrive and are recognized by the townsfolk forcing Slim to confront Mac about his activities on the property. Adding fuel to the fire are a couple of disgruntled cowboys stirring up trouble. When one of the small farms is raided and the owner killed, blame is laid directly on Mac's doorstep, putting Slim in the middle between his friend Mac and his friends in town. Tensions come to a head when Jess and the stage return to Laramie with the cattle money and are ambushed on the way to town. With lives and livelihoods at stake it's up to Slim to flush out the real thieves and killers.",

She's broke and one step ahead of the creditors because of her ne'er do well, cheating gambler of a husband, Ben Carson. Among his victims, Shanghai Pierce and his outfit from Texas, who are hot on his trail. Shanghai ends up locking horns with Jess Harper and then Slim Sherman and in the mêlée Ben Carson ends up out at the Sherman Ranch and Relay Station with Jonesy, who met Lily many years before at the height of her career. He's hoping to get her to sing one of his ditties and managers to get Carson to listen. Carson could care less because he's looking to swindle the town and Lily out of the receipts for the Laramie concert. It's up to Slim, Jess and ultimately Lily herself to stop him.",

What they don't realize is that there's more than one storm heading for the ranch when the stage from Laramie has to stop at the relay station to wait out the tornado. None of the passengers is who they seem, with one man on the run from the military and the law, a nun who isn't a nun, and a gambler who has more to gamble than his money. Add a bounty hunter and a gunman masquerading as a deputy marshal and it's a stormy situation that could cost the members of Sherman Ranch their lives.",

He especially wants Jess Harper fired one way or another which doesn't set well with Jess or Slim Sherman. Adding to Slim's problems are the fact that all the relay teams and some of his best quarter horses have been stolen. Slim and Jess have tracked the thieves but they are holed up in a canyon and it would be suicide to go after them without help. Slim and Jess go after the stolen horses with Jack Slade, after establishing an uneasy truce with the company man. They get the horses back but there's a steep price to pay with Slade gunning all the men guarding the horses. One wounded man gets away and ends up at the ranch where Jonesy and Andy try to help. Tension escalates when Slade finds Jonesy and Andy protecting the wounded man and forcing Slim and Jess to side with them. The wounded man's outlaw brother is tracking him and forces a showdown with Slim, Jess and Slade when he takes Andy to bargain for his brother. It's a showdown that costs lives.",

Patterson owns the stage line and he's been robbed of money that belongs to the company. The thief is Tom Mannering, the man his daughter Gloria loves and the loss of the money could ruin the stage line. Jess refuses the job to track Mannering to Alta Mesa until he finds out that Slim has an obligation to Patterson. He grudgingly accepts the job but enemies dog his trail and Gloria Patterson is following so that he doesn't gun down Mannering. Also on Mannering's trail is the man that he was supposed to give Patterson's money to. Gloria and Jess are finding that they are attracted to each other but it complicates the chase until they catch up with Mannering and Gloria get her eyes opened to the real Tom Mannering. Mannering's partner wants the money and he doesn't care who he kills to get it, including Jess Harper.",

Now it's five years later and he's back in Laramie, paroled to Slim Sherman and there are those in town that don't want him back. His only allies are Slim, Jess Harper and Laurie Allen, Doc Allen's daughter. It doesn't help Frank's case that Cameron Gault raised him as his own and that Chad Morgan, Gault's foreman, has designs on taking over the Gault empire and he's going to use every dirty trick in the book to make sure Frank Buckley goes back to prison. Morgan also targets Slim by threatening the stage drivers and nearly killing Jess by wrecking a stage. It's only when the secret is revealed that Frank and Laurie can get on with their lives and set the record straight about Jay Gault's death.",

When Pardee's partners attempt to break him out of jail, Sheriff Cory is wounded and presses Slim Sherman into service as acting sheriff with Jess Harper as his deputy. It's a job that Slim doesn't want but there's nobody else to protect Laramie from Tom Creighton, outlaw leader out to make sure that Billy doesn't hang for murder. With most of the townsfolk afraid to stand against Creighton, the odds are against Slim and Jess living long enough to carry out the execution an hour after dawn.",

Vern, having witnessed the murder, offers Jess a position with Owen Cantrell and Loren Corteen in their private army in the border dispute between the U.S. and Canada. Corteen is fostering a rebellion in the neutral territory and using as many gunmen as he can hire to fill the ranks. Jess agrees but it's evident early on that he doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the gun slicks that have been hired. He's causing too much trouble, asking too many questions and getting too friendly with the wrong girl. Jess is forced to kill Jamieson when the latter figures out that Jess isn't what he appears. His actions trap Jess in Corteen's lair and the only way out will be at the business end of a gun during the raid on a U.S. Army supply train. It's a race against time for Jess to prevent the raid, save the supply train and stop Corteen and Cantrell. His only ally in his dangerous game is the girl he got too friendly with.",

    "description": "Slim Sherman gets involved in a fracas with the surly Glen Bentley while rushing Jonesy into Laramie to see the doctor. Bentley is part of a wagon train laying over on the outskirts of town and is a loudmouthed bully. later in the day, Slim is forced into a gunfight with Bentley when the latter pulls a gun on an unarmed man. Bentley is badly wounded and later dies when the doctor can't be found in time. Though Slim is cleared of wrong doing at the sheriff's inquest, Ross, the assistant wagon master wants the job of wagon master, and will stoop to anything including lies to get it. He kidnaps Slim to try him for murder according to wagon train rules. Facing a hangman's noose Slim's only hope lies in the widow of the dead man and the wagon master seeing past the lies of Ross.",

One hold up is foiled but a second attempt by the stage driver, Frank Skinner, in Rockland City results in the death of Jack Adams, well liked manager of the stage office, and the loss of the money. The posse is unable to track Skinner and the sheriff is suspicious of Slim, when he starts cozying up to Skinner's girl, Annie. Slim is using Annie to find Skinner and it doesn't set well with him, especially when Annie starts having feelings for him he can't return. But his gamble pays off when Skinner's brother shows up takes Annie to Mesa Verde and Frank. Slim follows but his hunt for Skinner could cost him his life when Frank uses Annie to lure Slim into an ambush.",

The outlaw is riding a palomino horse with the Sherman Ranch brand so the sheriff returns the horse to Slim Sherman, hoping that Slim can identify the outlaw. Since the palomino, Cyclone, was stolen the year before Slim can't help. The arrival of Cyclone causes problems between Slim and his brother Andy when the high strung animal starts breaking fences and harassing the other Sherman horses. When Slim threatens to get rid of Cyclone, Andy takes Cyclone and runs away, only to find himself out of the frying pan and into the fire, first being injured in a windstorm and then getting rescued by the outlaws who robbed the bank. Boone Caudie sees Andy as a means of winning the widow Hannah's hand. His partners aren't happy with the arrangement and Andy's life is on the line when Pike and Dallas don't want him around when they rob the bank in Casper. Slim, who has been searching for Andy just might find him too late.",

Jessup owns the town and Jess is asking too many questions about Dan Preston. Preston is a prospector who helped Jess out of jam once and he's contacted Jess needing his help. Everybody in town denies ever hearing of Preston but circumstances convince Jess that whoever isn't in Jessup's pocket, like the sheriff, is too scared to talk. What little help he gets is from Mae at the hotel and Chuck, the deputy sheriff. When Jess' stubborn search nearly gets him killed, it's Mae who comes to his aid and admits what she knows about Dan and his gold strike. Time is running out for Dan unless Jess, Mae and Chuck can rescue him from Jessup's clutches and they'll risk their lives doing it.",

There's something about Gregg that doesn't set well with Jess, especially when Gregg brings up something in Slim's past, about his involvement with Ed McKeever and what happened at Adobe Wells. Slim and Andy's trust in Gregg is matched by Jess' mistrust and causes dissension between them. When Mort Cory is shot and wounded Jess believes it was Ed McKeever because Mort was with Slim during the Adobe Wells incident. Slim heads to town when the wounded Cory sends for him prompting Jess to stay behind to protect Andy and his suspicions are proved when McKeever and his men show up to set up an ambush for Slim.

Slim Sherman and Jess Harper, hoping to capitalize on the premium the stage company is offering, decide to buy stock from Sam Bronson in Colorado to sell to the stage line. Jess, having cheated on the coin toss with Slim, gets more than he bargained for on the trip. Sam Bronson's runaway daughter, horse thieves and a two-timing murdering Romeo are what's in store for him as he tries to get the horses back to Laramie by the July 1st deadline to collect the bonus.",

Jess rides into town to join the posse being formed by Clark. The posse finds themselves out-gunned by the Torrey gang and Clark breaks and runs after being grazed by a bullet.

Jarrad comes to Laramie with a warrant for Jess, an affidavit from a dead man and his eye on the bounty. Jess has no choice to but to go with Jarrad but Slim is hot on their trail after being deputized by the Laramie sheriff to see that Jess makes it to Willow alive. The Wilkies own Willow and Jess doesn't believe he'll get a fair trial, despite Slim's assurances, and effects an escape. Exhausted, Jess is easily recaptured, which puts him at odds with Slim. When word spreads that Jarrad has Jess in custody, it's fair game for others to collect the price on Jess' head. But the burning question is if neither Jess nor his dead partner killed Blake Wilkie, then the person who did is framing Jess for murder and doesn't want him making it to Willow alive.",

It isn't until Ben Parkison kidnaps Jess Harper and threatens to kill him that Slim risks his life to save Jess from hanging.",

A strange group of refugees have taken shelter at the station with Slim Sherman and Jess Harper; a bitter army widow, a lonely orphan boy, a gun-runner, a business man and his wife, a bandit and a gold filled strongbox. The atmosphere is far from festive with Sioux braves surrounding the ranch trying to kill the occupants. The only thing that seems to draw this disparate group together is one small orphan boy. Despite the desperate odds against their survival, they manage to cobble together a Christmas for the boy and one will give his life so that the rest can survive.",

Unfortunately the strangers he picks are Slim Sherman and Jess Harper who collect the reward, only to have it stolen from them by Kuba Smith himself. With the only clues the name on a watch and a location from ten years previous, Slim heads off to Prairie Lee to find Kuba's wife, only he finds Kuba's daughter Jane, instead.

When Jackson goes free after his trial for holding up the Laramie stage, events are set into motion to drive Jackson to steal again, only it costs the deputy sheriff his life.

Clint wants the $80,000 in gold that his brother hid and Jess is the only one that can lead Clint to the gold. Faced with a life or death decision, Jess has no choice but to agree and it's an arduous trek through the desert over a route Jess barely remembers. They are soon overtaken by Clint's cell mate Deke Belden and suddenly it's Belden calling the shots. When they arrive at the old mission where Jess caught up with Roy, Jess' life becomes forfeit but they aren't alone. Someone saves Jess but it allows Clint and Deke the opportunity to find the gold. It becomes everyman for himself and Jess just may end up on the losing end of any bargain.",

When Lake is later killed, circumstantial evidence points to Slim as the murderer. Jess is Slim's only hope to clear him of the murder. The puzzle gets only more convoluted with a odd assortment of characters all looking for a Durango cavalry spur that is purported to contain a map to the fabled Lost Dutchman Mine.

In a fit of rage when Jess fights back, Stack takes everything off the stage and leaves Scotty, Jess and the passengers to die. Stripping what they can from the stage the five set off across the desert trailing Stack and his men. It's a perilous journey with no food, no water, no horses and no weapons but it becomes evident that there is no honor among thieves as, one by one, they find bodies of the gang as they trek through the wasteland. For Jess Harper this journey will end one way only when he and the surviving passengers make it to Rawlings.",

Slim Sherman suggests using the Old Laramie road until things settle down but the road needs repair. With Jess Harper off scouting for the Army, Slim manages to round up a odd assortment of citizens to work on the road but they find themselves under attack almost from the beginning and it's not by the Sioux. Someone in their small band is systematically picking them off one by one. Bad luck is dogging them at every turn as Slim tries to solve the mystery of who is doing the killing and why. He might find the answers a little too late.",

He asks Slim to take the job of foreman because he's convinced that the money Sheila's husband stole and hid before he died is somewhere on the ranch. Slim takes the job but no one is what they seem from the hands to Sheila herself. As Slim gets closer to the truth about the money the more danger he's in until the truth is finally revealed.",

Due to the broken axle on the wagon they are forced lay over at Sherman Ranch to make repairs and give Slim and Jess a lesson in Japanese culture, though it leaves Jess a little bruised. Determined to repay Slim and Jess for their kindness, the troupe puts on an evenings entertainment that turns violent when the outlaws take over the ranch looking for the opium.

Things get complicated when Cole finds out his wife has died just recently and that his step-daughter, Mary, hates him. They are joined by Danny Hode, son of his late partner and finally Damon Johntry, his other partner. Hode wants Cole dead, Johntry wants the money, and John Cole bargains the payroll for the lives of Mary and Slim.

Outlaw Matt Dyer and his gang arrive and take Jess, Ma and her grand-daughter Sue, hostage while he waits for his girlfriend. Dyer is a cruel man who enjoys toying with his hostages while he waits, but he doesn't know that the sheriff has his girlfriend in jail. The danger increases when the posse searching for Dyer shows up at the ranch, though Ma denies seeing anything of Dyer. The sheriff isn't fooled but can't do anything because of the hostages. With the house surrounded by the posse, Dyer uses Jess and the others as human shields to prevent the posse from storming the house. Dyer's plan backfires and the posse forces his hand and the outlaws, including Dyer, scatter but Jess won't let Dyer get away.",

Defying an Army edict for helping the Blackfoot lands Jess in hot water. The boy, Lame Wolf, would see them all dead except for the hope of fixing the lameness that has turned his own father against him. The scalp hunter, having had the boy taken from him twice, would see Jess' scalp numbered among his trophies. When a sympathetic Army surgeon fixes the boy's leg, it opens up an opportunity to make peace with the Blackfoot. The scalp hunter has other ideas which drives the boy, with Mike, into the hills to search for his father and prove that he is his father's son. With the scalp hunter following behind it's up to Jess stop him before anyone gets hurt.",

Slim Sherman, who was present at the massacre and a witness at the court martial, finds himself taken hostage by the colonel's daughter, Madge, who's come to Laramie carrying papers that will guarantee her father's vision for the Native American population is carried out. What Barrington doesn't know is that he's lost support in Washington and he's now viewed as a traitor. For Slim it's out of the frying pan and into the fire when he escapes only to find that there are Sioux in the area. Now trapped with Barrington and a handful of his loyal officers, Slim has to negotiate with the Sioux warriors, who want Barrington to pay for his crimes. Slim, Madge, Barrington, and his men just might end up a sacrifice to Barrington's arrogance.",

He finds himself on the trail of Jean Lavelle and her family who have been stealing cattle from the larger ranches as payback. Her brother Ralph is responsible for the theft of the Sherman Ranch stock and putting a determined Slim on their trail. In a shootout with Jean, Slim is wounded but captures her anyway. Slim risks his life, determined to take Jean to Cheyenne to stand trial and minimize the risk of her being lynched, all the while being trailed by Ralph and the sheriff of Edgerton. With his bullet wound festering, it is questionable whether he and Jean will make it to Cheyenne alive.",

What Jess doesn't realize is that Murkland saw him in Laramie with the U.S. Marshal that was escorting the stage, and that fact might get Jess killed.",

Compounding matters, Morgan was found to be innocent of the murder and Jess's fatal shot caught Morgan in the back. Morgan wasn't without friends and they, along with Morgan's girl Gladys, plot to make sure the Morgan's brothers, Mac and Al, pay Jess back for killing Joe. With Sheriff Corey using Jess as bait to draw Al and Mac out and Slim injured, it's too dangerous for Jess to be at the ranch. Then Jess injures his gun hand after a dust up with Joe's lowlife friends, putting him a disadvantage in any gunfight. It's a game of cat and mouse to see who will be victor, Jess or the Morgan brothers.",

    "description": "Walt Douglas is an executive of the stage line who comes to Laramie looking for his estranged daughter Alicia and stops off at Sherman Ranch and Relay Station to ask Slim Sherman, Daisy Cooper and Jess Harper if they've seen her. Slim and Daisy haven't but Jess has and only admits it to Slim after Walt leaves. Jess knows Alicia at Leora, a saloon hostess he's met in town. What neither of them knows is that Leora/Alicia is involved with Cass and Willard, a couple saddle tramps looking to steal the mining payroll that's coming in. Slim rides to Laramie hoping to convince Leora/Alicia to speak to her father and makes an enemy of Cass. All Leora/Alicia wants to do is shoot him and does. Walt Douglas won't press charges but Mort Cory will so Slim offers to keep Walt and Alicia out at the ranch until a hearing can be arranged. Cass and Willard decide that it would be easier to steal the payroll from the relay station and take Slim, Daisy, Alicia and Walt hostage until the stage come in the next day. It becomes a tense waiting game with Daisy trying to convince Alicia to turn her back on Cass and give her father a chance. With Willard not planning on leaving any witnesses, time is running out for the hostages.",

Gandy starts working at the ranch but the Wellman gang wants Gandy's safe cracking services and will stop at nothing, including framing him for a stage robbery and murder, to get him to help them rob a bank in Granite City. Things get complicated when Jess ends up escorting Gandy back to Cheyenne with the sheriff and ends up inadvertently aiding him to escape. When the authorities in Cheyenne discover that Gandy Ross was not part of the stage hold up, Jess heads to Granite City and Gandy's girl friend Amy to try and stop Gandy from making a big mistake, which puts Jess in the middle of helping with a bank robbery. Time is running out for Jess, Gandy, and Amy because Sam Wellman intends on leaving no witnesses.",

With information from Jess, Slim Sherman, still sworn in as Mort Cory's deputy, is able to trail the thieves until they split up. Slim catches up with one, killing him in self defense, which puts Slim in danger when it turns out that the man he killed is Hank McGovern, son of Ellen McGovern, wealthy rancher in the area. Ellen refuses to believe her son guilty of theft and attempted murder especially since Slim cannot produce the money or a witness. With Slim's status as a deputy affording him some protection, Ellen McGovern puts a price on his head. Slim is in a race against time to prove Hank's guilt and find the money before Hank's partner and he loses his own life. Slim's only allies are the reluctant Laurie McGovern, sister of the dead man and the equally reluctant Jim Lassel, Ellen's ranch foreman.",

He refuses but is 'convinced' to do it anyway when his daughter Ellen is threatened. Jess Harper was riding shotgun on the stage that was supposed to carry the payroll but wasn't able to pick it up because of flooding. The gang doesn't know this and try for the payroll anyway, but Richards double crosses them and is shot because they believe he stole the money. The wounded Richards meets up with Daisy Cooper and Mike Williams on the road and they take him back to Sherman Ranch and Relay Station, despite the fact the gang is searching for him. Richards wound is not fatal, yet. The damage done by the bullet will kill him in months. Slim Sherman and Jess Harper aren't happy with having Irv at the ranch but he can't be moved so now they are faced with protecting not only Daisy and Mike from Irv's gang but also Irv himself.",

Jess meets up with Roger Canby, real owner of the gold and they chase down Anne and Stede, but Canby is not the jolly person he appears.

Jess tries to get Bryne arrested but skinflint stage office manager Art Potter won't press charges. To further complicate matters Potter finds out about Jess' checkered past and orders him to stay away from the stage. Mort Cory gets Jess to catch up with the stage outside town. The stage is robbed anyway with Mose and Jess getting wounded. Jess chases down the thief who grabbed the strong box but he doesn't have the money. It's now a case of who's got the money and puts Roy and Martha Halloran squarely in the cross hairs because Martha found the strong box and Roy insists on keeping the money, lying to friends and himself. His lies could cost him Martha, his friend Jess Harper, his honor and their lives.",
