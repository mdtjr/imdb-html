    "description": "At breakfast, Mr. Moulterd show the gang that they are front page news in the paper, which they find somewhat disgraceful. When it's time to go into town to attend Mrs. Slocombe's trial for speeding and stealing a horse cart, Miss Lovelock offers Captain Peacock to drive him on her motorbike. After he has been reminiscing of yesteryear about racing with the bike, they both try it once around the yard - which makes Peacock decide to ride with the others, on the pig cart, instead. However, Mr. Rumbold rides with her on the bike, all dressed in leather with boots and rivets. When they arrive in court, the magistrate mistakes him for someone belonging to Hell's Angels and orders him out of the room. Various persons are called to the stand as witnesses, but their different attempts to help Mrs. Slocombe rather seem to work in her disadvantage. In the end, it's the rough Mr. Moulterd who saves the day, when presenting the magistrate (who also happens to be a lord), with a pheasant, shot on his lands by the cart owner. The case is dismissed. When they have all returned to the manor and intend to go to bed, Mrs. Slocombe and Miss Brahms are disturbed by Captain Peacock doing yoga and Mr. Humphries tries to bolt his door, in order for Miss Moulterd not to come and sleep in his bed. However, she simply enters the room through the other door and soon crawls into bed beside him.",

    "description": "On the morning after Mrs. Slocombe's trial, there are complaints that Captain Peacock has been using too much hot water for his bath. Secondly, Miss Brahms makes several sarcastic remarks about his interest in Miss Lovelock. However, other matters soon arise. As Mr. Rumbold announces that some Americans are coming to stay for the weekend, different chores are divided between the gang and they carry them out to various success. Mr. Humphries helps Mavis with clearing out the drains, Mrs. Slocombe and Miss Brahms hang the bed sheets out to dry (only to have them run over by Mr. Moulterd on his tractor) and Captain Peacock utterly fails to control the ride-on lawn mower, making a big hole in the hedge. As a result, none of them are very cheerful at lunch and the other chores (vacuum cleaning and \"teasling\" the laundry) do not help improve their temper. The good news is, there are two staff applicants to be interviewed, one chamber maid and one cook. However, after the gang have interviewed them and found out they cannot employ them, their temper sinks again. As a result of their bickering, Mavis decides they won't have any supper - except for Mr. Humphries, whom she has come to like more and more.",

    "description": "In the afternoon after the gang's ordeals with their different chores, Mr. Rumbold announces that some Americans are coming to stay at the hotel the next day. Secondly, there is a photographer coming in the evening to have the staff's picture taken. The problem with both these situations is, that they have no staff, since Mr. Rumbold \"accidentally\" fired them earlier during the week. As they look at the picture of the staff on an old brochure, they find out that they themselves resemble the old staff and eventually, after some discussion, decide to play the staff when the picture is taken and possibly also when the Americans arrive. After some initial trouble, the photographer can finally take the picture. However, at the next moment Miss Lovelock walks in and points out that she has stayed in many hotels and is capable of telling whether they'll meet the standard of hotel staff or not. She makes quite a few rearrangements as to who will play which part. In the evening, there's a thunderstorm raging and all electricity goes. When Mrs. Slocombe's cat goes missing, they all wander around in the dark, trying to find it, while it seems that the legend of the ghost, who is said to wander about during such stormy nights, is more than a legend, when several of them are frightened by it.",

Mr. Humphries even has to milk the cow in order to get milk for Miss Brahms's baking. At lunch, Mr. Frobisher arrives with a check for half of the sum the Americans will pay for their visit. The other half will be paid when they, and particularly their \"tour leader\", are completely satisfied, which will be when they have experienced the service in the local country church and the \"harvest thanksgiving dance\". The service goes very well, but before they can perform the dance, they must salvage on of the guest's false teeth, which are nearly eaten by a goat. As in the afternoon, the rain starts pouring down, the episode ends with whole gang performing the dance indoors.",

    "description": "When the Americans have gone, new issues ensue. At breakfast, Captain Peacock, Mrs. Slocombe and Miss Brahms discuss the development of the relationship between Mr. Humphries and Mavis. In the hall, when Mrs. Slocombe has read a letter from her friend Mrs. Axleby and has related it to Miss Brahms, Captain Peacock comes down the stairs, announcing he has found a gun in a desk drawer in his room. As he accidentally fires it, he narrowly misses Mr. Humphries, who faints. When Mr. Rumbold telephones the police to ask them to take care of the gun, he cannot deliver the complete message, before the police come rushing to the manor. The sergeant thinks Captain Peacock is a terrorist who has taken the others hostage and as they all try to explain the situation, the sergeant becomes more and more convinced that they are all insane and in bed with each other. In the end, he leaves them be, urging them, next time they find a gun, not to call the police but to \"call the army and tell them to bring a social worker and a priest\".",

Apparently, the annual local cricket match has always been held on the manor lands and she asks them if this tradition may be continued. They all agree and since there are mixed teams, the inhabitants of the manor all decide to make a team in the competition. After they've had some trouble preparing the event, both with the painting of the creases and the raising of the tent beside the field, Mr. Thorpe arrives and they ask him to be their umpire, which he agrees to. When they are also introduced to some members of the opposite team, one of them, Malcolm, appears to fancy Mavis and does not take lightly to the fact that she fancies Mr. Humphries. He therefore threatens him and does what he can to make the game very hard for Mr. Humphries. After an exciting match, which the gang wins, Malcolm is unfortunately knocked out by the ball hitting him on the head, but Mr. Humphries feels it safest to keep running, since he doesn't want to be around when Malcolm comes around.",

    "description": "When the latest guests, a group of monks from a silent order, have been seen off, Mr. Rumbold complains that his authority is being undermined, particularly by Captain Peacock. The others respond that it's because he uses his authority a bit too much over them. This makes him start acting more humbly - even a bit too humble in the others' eyes. The next moment, Mr. Moulterd comes in, announcing that the local pub challenges the gang to a game of darts. They agree to accept, but first, they are to take the flock of sheep to the farm next door, as the farmer has bought them. After this task has caused more trouble than it's worth, with the sheep running away, they all go into town, to the pub. There, they discover that said farmer is captain of the other dart team and also the father of Malcolm Heathcliff, Mr. Humphries' \"rival\" for Mavis. When the dart match has begun, a brawl starts between the teams, which leads to Mr. Heathcliff and Mr. Rumbold stepping outside to have it out. They are however interrupted by Mrs. Slocombe, who fights Mr. Heathcliff off with her handbag. In the ordeal, they find out that the sheep they sold are not going to be used only for the wool - but they are also being sent to the butcher's. Mrs. Slocombe can't accept those \"cuddly\" sheep being slaughtered and when they have all returned to the manor, she talks the others into rescuing them and returning the money, with Captain Peacock as leader of the \"raid\". In the dead of night, they rescue the sheep, with Mr. Humphries having to deal with Mr. Heathcliff's guard dog, who turns out not to be particularly fearsome after all. He manages to put the money in the letter box, but the others are less lucky with the sheep - who run off again. However, they return to the manor, along with several other sheep, which the gang hadn't been counting on.",

    "description": "Mr. Humphries and Miss Moulterd take a horse and carriage ride into town, to pick up Mr. Thorpe when his train arrives. On their way there, Malcolm Heathcliff catches up with them on his bike, once again threatening Mr. Humphries not to come near Miss Moulterd. When Mr. Thorpe has arrived, he informs the gang that a group of guests from Outer Mongolia will arrive, but unfortunately, they paid for their stay in their Mongolian currency in advance, when it was 200 to the British pound. Now, it is 500 to the pound, which means what they have paid is not worth even half of what it was. However, as they still expect to be entertained, the gang first discuss various ways of providing entertainment, even auditioning people from the village. In the end, they decide to perform for the Mongolians themselves. In the evening, when the Mongolians have gathered in the main hall, Mr. Rumbold plays the piano, whilst Mrs. Slocombe and Captain Peacock perform a scene from the opera \"Veronique\", Miss Brahms recites a scene from \"The Merchant of Venice\" and Miss Lovelock and Mr. Humphries perform a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet\" as a ballet. They all end the show with a performance of \"Rule Britannia\".",
