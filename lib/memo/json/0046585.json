George has concerns about diamonds being smuggled over the Mexican border. Jackson flies down to New Mexico to investigate and accidentally picks up readings of diamonds in the desert. Jackson lands to investigate, and deducts that someone is using herds of wild horses to run diamonds back and forward between Mexico and the United States. While out investigating, someone tries to shoot Jackson but escapes. Later the shooter meets two other men and discusses the situation. Jackson follows a set of horse prints till they stop at tire tracks. There they find a discarded horseshoe with a diamond in it. Heading to the local town they see the sheriff. It is arranged to drive the wild herd through the town, and the trained horse will join them and betray its owner, assumed to be the leader of the smuggling ring. The plan works and the sheriff arrests the men",

Later at the police station, the piece together clues left by Elwood and realize the roll of film shows an undiscovered Moon orbiting only a 1000 miles from Earth.

While searching Chinatown they are attacked in a restaurant after having received a clue to the whereabouts of the data. The new lead requires them to take one of the Chinese to Vancouver in Canada. The man turns out to be the agent they are looking for and hijack's Jackson's plane. Jackson puts the craft into a steep dive until the man passed out and died because of the extreme G force.

Jackson agrees and decides to talk to the meat merchant. The butcher is amicable and agrees to help the boy out. As the pair leave, two men enter the shop. Jackson recognizes one of them as the guard from the bank robbery earlier in the day and organizes Ikkie and the boy to follow the men.

Jackson follows up on Ikkie's lead and attempts to apprehend the two men, but is himself ambushed by a third gangster. The three criminals regroup and decide to dispose of Jackson in the ice cooler. Ikkie goes back to HQ and calls all secret squadron members to be on the lookout for Jackson. As the criminals get ready to divide up the money and leave town, they discover Jackson has substituted it with meat, and decide to return to take care of him.

Jackson suggests a number of solutions, all rejected for various reasons. Jackson then agrees to meet with the business man, who point blank refuses to sell, no matter how much Jackson tries to sweeten the deal. Back at HQ Jackson is convinced he's seen the man before and goes through his records till he identifies the bank robber and a number of his associates. We discover the businessman has dug under the lot and is tunneling to a nearby bank. A curious child discovers what is going on and sounds the secret squadron alarm. Jackson arrives, a fist fight breaks out and all the criminals are apprehended. Jackson makes arrangements for the vacant lot to be returned to open land and the boys to never have their baseball diamond threatened again",

    "description": "Professor Morgan requests the help of Jackson's chief scientist 'Tut' an experiment he's working on consistently fails. He wants to relocate to Jackson's labs and try again. The experiment continues to fail and no one understands why. Unseen at Jacksons labs, a man has setup a gun on a nearby hill and is disrupting the experimenters using sound waves. Prof Morgan's assistant is seen at a meeting with the inventor of the gun Vranki. The gun is destined to be delivered to a foreign government but first Vranki wants to kill Morgan in an act of revenge. On the mountain, Jackson theorizes someone is using a sound gun to attack the labs. He believes he can use metal shielding special shaped to send the sound charge back to the point of origin. Vranki calls Jackson, claiming to be the now injured Henderson's doctor. Jackson video traces the call, and recognizes a number of the men in the room and knows the illness is a charade. He further plans to accompany Morgan on his visit to the dying assistant. The pair walk into the expected trap and Vranki begins shooting at them and taunting them about their intended death. Vranki thinks he has killed the couple emerges from cover only to be ambushed by Jackson. Vranki makes a break for it and ends up on a building ledge, before surrendering to Jackson.",

Suddenly a former criminal and explosives expert that Jackson captured 'Vulmer' calls Jackson and threatens terrorist action. Jackson calls on members of Secret Squadron to report any sightings of the man. Vulmers first target is Judge Bell, the man who put him behind bars. Jackson through his Secret Squadron network tracks Vulmer down. Vulmer appears to have left the location, but Jackson's suspicions are raised and he decides to sneak back to the apartment and investigate. He finds a clue that suggests a pen given to the judge may be a bomb. Jackson gives chase unaware Ikkie also has one of the pens. Jackson intercepts the judge's car on the way home and destroys both pens. Not realizing the plan failed Vulmer arranges his next attack, Jackson himself. Jackson returns to the apartment and is knocked unconscious. Vulmer then replaces his money clip with one containing explosives before he wakes up. Unwittingly Jackson continues his investigation, completely ignorant he is carrying a bomb. He eventually tracks down Vukmer and his gang and attacks them. During the fight that breaks out Jackson discovers the danger in his money clip and disposes the bomb at the last second.",
