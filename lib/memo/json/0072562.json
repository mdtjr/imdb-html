    "description": "The host for the episode is George Carlin, and the musical guests are Billy Preston and Janis Ian. The skits for this episode are as follows: an ESL teacher gives increasingly bizarre sentences to his student, who repeats his every word; until the teacher suffers a fatal heart attack, and the student dutifully acts out an identical \"death\". New Dad Insurance offers bereaved families a new father to take the place of their deceased one. A distraught rape victim in a courtroom describes the attacker's words in writing, which then confuses an inattentive jurist. Andy Kaufman sings along with a Mighty Mouse record. A reporter interviews the victim of a shark bite who, despite his claims to the contrary, obviously still has all his limbs. Two men, claiming to be a married couple, discuss the benefits of a new vitamin product called Jamitol. A mock ad for pain-reliever Triopenin plays up the product's child-proof caps. Albert Brooks presents a documentary titled \"The Impossible Truth,\" in which he presents several shocking news stories. In the maternity ward of a hospital for bees, father bees anxiously wait to find out if their children will be drones or workers. The Academy of Better Careers offers people an exciting new life answering telephones. Valri Bromfield presents a monologue as a volleyball coach giving some very personal advice to her players before a game. In a mock commercial parodying Lark cigarettes, a truck rolls through town asking people to show their guns. A home security system installer breaks into a couple's home and scares them to death to demonstrate how much they need an alarm installed. Finally, another mock commercial presents 3-bladed razors as an absolute household necessity. During the show, George Carlin performs monologues on blue food, religion, baseball vs. football, and other observations. During the Weekend Update, Chevy Chase reports about President Ford blowing his nose and Emperor Hirohito visiting Disneyland. Billy Preston performs \"Nothing from Nothing\" and \"Fancy Lady,\" while Janis Ian performs \"At Seventeen\" and \"In the Winter\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: a man in a wheelchair inadvertently discovers he can walk, but is unable to repeat the miraculous feat. Rob Reiner performs a number of lounge-singer acts. The National Pancreas Association stresses the importance of taking good care of your pancreas. Rob Reiner, together with his wife Penny Marshall, honors some of the more popular fashion faux-pas. The Golden Needles voodoo acupuncture technique offers healing without surgery. Andy Kaufmann sings along with a record of Pop Goes the Weasel. In an interview with Squeaky Fromme, Fromme keeps trying to assassinate the interviewer, only to fail each time. Dance group The Lockers perform a comic dance. A man speaks out against defamation of droolers. An ad for a moving company promotes their skill at moving people from place to place, though not their belongings. A pair of nuns attempt to emcee their church's talent night. Albert Brooks presents a film about heart surgery. Gilda Radner recites a list of things she ate that day. Rob Reiner blows up at having his ending skit interrupted by the Bees, only to have his rant backfire. During the Weekend Update, Don Pardo is kidnapped and used by the kidnappers to announce their demands.",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Candice Bergen (her second appearance), and the musical guests are Martha Reeves and The Stylistics. The skits for this episode are as follows: President Ford delivers a special message for Christmas and falls out of a tree. An ad for a restaurant where customers can choose their cow, kill it and butcher it. A boy calls home from the police station to tell his parents he's killed 26 people. Candice Bergen invites people to send home movies to NBC, then shows her own movie of herself ice skating with the Bees. A young man comes out of the closet and admits to his family that he's an elf. A pair of strangers at a laundromat share a vicarious romance through their clothes. Two men discuss the prowess one of them has at pinball, while playing Pong. Gilda Radner lists off the things she ate at last year's Christmas. Margaret Kuhn delivers an inspirational message about growing old, and Gary Weiss presents a film about travelers returning home for the holidays. During the Weekend Update, Laraine Newman comments on the New Year's festivities, even though it's still a week early, while Chevy Chase reports from the wrong location and Emily Litella gets worked up over firing the handicapped. Martha Reeves performs \"Higher & Higher\" and \"Silver Bells\". The Stylistics perform \"You Make Me Feel Brand New\". Candice Bergen performs \"Winter Wonderland\".",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Anthony Perkins, and the musical guest is Betty Carter. The skits for this episode are as follows: Chevy Chase delivers a long and rambling monologue in which he berates critics who claim the cast deliberately wastes time to fill up a 90-minute time slot. In his opening monologue, Anthony Perkins attempts to dispel the common perception that he is creepy, only to finish by eating a fly. President Ford shares his thoughts on marijuana usage. A new dominatrix cleaning service tries to whip lazy housewives into shape. Norman Bates pitches his new school of hotel management, only to be interrupted by his unseen mother. During the weekend update, John Belushi ponders why lions and lambs were chosen to represent March weather and what greater significance they may have, while Emily Litella gets upset over calls to preserve natural race horses. A student complains to her teacher about getting a literal Bee as her grade. A set of movie trailers advertise low-budget horror films in the style of Psycho. Other skits include land scarcity and intra-office extramarital romance. Betty Carter performs \"Music, Maestro, Please\", \"Swing Brother Swing\" and \"I Can't Help It\".",

    "description": "The host for the episode is press secretary to President Ford Ron Nessen, and the musical guest is Patti Smith. The skits for this episode are as follows: The opening act features a return of the dead string quartet. Ron Nessen's opening monologue includes a message from the actual President Ford. An ad for the Bass o' Matic promises a new way for viewers to enjoy bass. Nessen asks the president for permission to appear on a new comedy show, then briefs his boss on his daily schedule. A string of jam advertisers pitch products with increasingly disgusting names, since they must taste good to sound so repulsive. A number of skits feature historic figures like Catherine the Great, Oedipus and Thomas Jefferson. During the Weekend Update, Emily Litella becomes upset over presidential erections. Gary Weis presents a film about the dumps that handle New York's garbage, and the men who work there. An ad pitches new Autumn Fizz carbonated douche. Billy Crystal performs a stand-up routine about the old-time jazz greats he used to know. Re-run ads pitch graffiti wallpaper and Try-hard batteries. Patti Smith performs \"Gloria\" and \"My Generation\".",

A preview for the upcoming series, Wilderness Comedian, presents a man who does stand-up comedy for animals. Baba Wawa attempts to interview Marlene Dietrich, but neither can understand what the other is saying. At a slumber party, several girls are disgusted by the thought of how babies are made. A spokesman for impoverished families in Namibia asks people to please donate their fondue sets. The Bride of Frankenstein gets up from her slab and sings \"I Feel Pretty\". During the Weekend Update, Emily Litella wonders why everyone is upset over violins on television. Pat Nixon drunkenly writes her memoirs about Richard's nervous breakdown during his final days in the White House. Madeline Kahn performs \"Lost in the Stars\" and Carly Simon performs \"You're So Vain\" and \"Half a Chance\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: Chevy Chase, lying on his back after a tremendous fall, is informed that the control room clock was running fast and he'll have to do it all again to get it on air. During her opening monologue, Dyan Cannon confesses to a lifelong dream of being swept off her feet by a man on a white horse, and during the rest of the show, different male cast members attempt to re-interpret its meaning to make themselves her dream man. A woman takes a taste test to see which is better: a new diet soda or a glass of phlegm. Participants in a hearing test don't notice that their teacher has been taken hostage by a pair of wanted criminals. A husband catches her wife having an affair, but the woman and her lover make up an outrageous story to explain everything. A Bulgarian travel agent attempts to convince a woman to vacation in Bulgaria. During the Weekend Update, a man claims to have a new version of Howard Hughes' will. Anita Bryant attempts to pitch Florida orange juice while being held hostage in Beirut. A priest tries to deliver a funeral eulogy, but is interrupted by a bad case of hiccups. Roy Waddmaker attempts to sell bathwater of the stars. A soldier gets berated by his drill sergeant for repeatedly flubbing his lines in a recruitment ad. A teenage girl is hoping to make an impression on her dream date, but her parents discover that her date is actually three Hell's Angels. In an home movie, a hubcap thief gets caught up in his work and dragged around town by an oblivious driver. Leon and Mary Russell perform \"Satisfy You\" and \"Daylight\"(with John Belushi as Joe Cocker).",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Buck Henry (his second appearance), and the musical guest is Gordon Lightfoot. The skits for this episode are as follows: Chevy Chase announces that because he broke his ankle accepting his Emmy Award, his fall will be done by Laraine Newman, but Laraine instead shoves him off the stage. Buck Henry is supposed to come on for his opening monologue, but is nowhere to be found; after a frantic search, the crew discovers that the security guards don't recognize him and won't let him in the building. Lounge singer Peter Lemon advertises a mood ring that changes color as he sings. The samurai tailor performs alterations on a customer's suit. The host of a call-in show tries to get more controversial when nobody calls him. A restaurant owner invites guest to try his all-toad cuisine. During the Weekend Update, the Patty Hearst trial is reenacted with fruit. Lorne Michaels repeats his offer to the Beatles, adding another $200 to the deal. Baba Wawa interviews film director Lina W. Gary Weis presents a film of Buck Henry interviewing people shopping for toilet seats. Jane Curtain interviews the author of a new sex book, only to find he is painfully shy. Garrett Morris sings \"An Die Musik\" and Michael O'Donaghue does an impression of Tony Orlando and Dawn with needles stuck in their eyes. Gordon Lightfoot performs \"Summertime Dream\" and \"Spanish Moss\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: John Belushi and Chevy Chase have an argument over how the opening to the show should be done. After Louise Lasser's opening monologue, General Idi Amin comes on to warn viewers about the importance of checking oneself for V.D., using himself as an example of the effects of advanced-stage syphilis. In a parody of Swedish films, a couple involved in a secret affair fool death by sending him out for a pizza. An advertisement pitches potholders made from human hair. Chevy Chase presents the Weekend Update, with a special segment on Olga Korbut. Two teenage girls discuss the hazards of dating with a padded bra and whether they'd want to see a guy naked. The Preservation Hall Jazz Band performs \"Panama\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: Chevy Chase, in the hospital after injuring himself in the previous episode, coaches Gilda Radner through the opening via telephone. Norman Lear gets to hear what the actors in his shows really think of him. Jimmy Carter discusses lust in his heart and looks forward to more lusting as president. Norman Lear reviews the pilot of a new show about a family of snake handlers in Pittsburgh. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain discusses the Ford-Carter debate, Patty Hearst's sentencing, Elton John's sexuality and the sex lives of nuns, while Laraine Newman reports from Times Square for the upcoming Jewish New Year. The women of SNL sing a get-well song for Chevy, wishing he would fall for them. A spokesman from the U.S. Council of Standards and Measures talks about the advantages of switching over to metric time. A divorce lawyer gets rough with his client while trying to make her claims sound believable. Boz Scaggs performs \"Low Down\" and \"What Can I Say?\"",

    "description": "There's no host for this broadcast. Randy Newman is the musical guest for this episode, which is performed live in New Orleans for the Mardi Gras celebration. The skits for this episode are as follows: President Carter attempts to inspire Americans with a speech delivered from the rear end of a statue of Andrew Jackson on his horse, while Rosalyn frets over the fact that Jimmy has been up there for two days. For his opening monologue, Randy Newman sings about the floods that damaged New Orleans, then announces that SNL teams are in place to cover the passing of the Bacchus Parade. Jane Curtain and Buck Henry report on the crowds in the street, then watch the traditional 'Let's hit Al Hirt in the Mouth with a Brick!' contest, in which Al Hirt gets pelted with debris as he attempts to play the trumpet. A repeat ad pitches Quarry, the breakfast cereal made entirely of minerals. Three women complain about the lack of men at the parade, then get picked up by a gang of biker bees. Garrett Morris performs a selection of songs by Fats Domino, but can only play the same bar of music for each. A Gary Weis film features an interview with a man who paints above-ground tombs in a cemetery. Tom Snyder stands in front of the Pink Lady strip club, where he interviews a bouncer named Honker and a dancer named Velocity. As Buck and Jane continue to wait for the Bacchus Parade to arrive, Baba Wawa interviews Henry Winkler on how he separates his own persona from his character, The Fonz. Ricky Mussolini performs a re-enactment of his grandfather's historic visit to New Orleans. Eric Idle attempts to interview Mardi Gras revelers, but the French Quarter café he's in is completely deserted. Another Gary Weis film shows a montage of signs all using the word Dixie. Penny Marshall reports from the Krewe of Apollo Ball, where all the attendees, both débutantes and escorts, are men. Stanley Kowalski stands in the street shouting for Stella, only to find he's in front of the wrong building. Paul Schaffer sings the Antler Dance song, while Mr. Mike dances and gets pelted with objects from the crowds. For the Weekend Update, Garrett Morris receives the combination to the city from Mayor Landrieau, Evel Kenivel jumps the Mardi Gras parade in his hospital bed, Larraine Newman interviews a man carrying on the Mardi Gras tradition of taping mice to his eyes, and Emily Litella interviews a liver-boat captain. Captain Jean Lafitte insists that, despite his historical reputation, he is not a pirate. Back at the Krewe of Apollo Ball Penny Williams and Cindy Marshall report on the crowning of the Queen of the Ball. Back on the parade route, Buck and Jane give up on the Bacchus Parade showing up, and wish everyone a good night. Randy Newman performs \"Louisiana 1927\", \"Marie\", \"Kingfish\" and \"Sail Away\", and The New Leviathan Oriental Fox Trot Orchestra performs \"Rebecca Came Back From Mecca\".",

The pot growers of America urge everyone to buy locally. Nixon gives an interview to David Frost but turns out to be terribly boring. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain reports on an iceberg floating from Antarctica, Alex Haley being accused of plagiarism, and Groucho Marx's former manager, Bill Murray talks about punishing schoolgirls, and Emily Litella confesses her love for Tom Snyder. Two boxers face off to get the most laughs. A low budget film depicts the Battle of Britain. A host and guest conduct an interview based solely of nonsense words. Alan Price performs \"Poor People\" and Neil Innes performs \"Cheese & Onions\" and \"Shangri-La\".",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Shelley Duvall, and the musical guest is Joan Armatrading. The skits for this episode are as follows: The opening act is interrupted by an announcement that NBC wants to get their money's worth out of the recent Bobick-Norton fight by replaying it at the start of every show. The women of the show sing as the Video Vixens. A bank robber is upset that his disguise isn't as good as those of the other members of his gang. Three women are joined in a restaurant by three men arguing over which one is Ricardo Montalban. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain reports on David Frost's presidential interviews, Patty Hearst's personal life and Roy Roger's funeral plans, while boxer Duane Bobick makes a plea for better civil rights so blacks will stop beating up white people, and Emily Litella fails to show up for her commentary. Elvis tries his hand at Shakespeare. Baba Wawa interviews Richard Burton on the subject of Elizabeth Taylor. Leonard Plith-Garnell reviews bad ballet. Members of the Moonies start turning violent. Joan Armatrading performs \"Love & Affection\" and \"Down to Zero\".",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Steve Martin (his third appearance), and the musical guest is Jackson Browne. The skits for this episode are as follows: Burt Lance, President Carter's budget management director, pitches the National Express charge card after being asked to resign. During his opening monologue, Steve Martin promotes his new album and confesses that his cat has been embezzling from him. An ad introduces a watch so complex that it requires two people to operate it. The wild and crazy Festrunk brothers try to pick up two girls in their apartment rec room. A defense attorney berates a rape victim on the witness stand, then chuckles about it afterward. A great moment in rock history is commemorated: Roy Orbison standing completely still while singing in sunglasses. An ad promotes the Royale Deluxe II, a sedan that rides smoothly enough for a rabbi to perform a circumcision in the back seat at 40mph. Jackson Browne performs \"Runnin' on Empty\" and \"The Pretender\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: President Carter gives his State of the Union address, but the members of Congress are bored by it. During his opening monologue, Steve Martin accuses John Belushi of stealing from him, then explains how to avoid paying taxes. A forest ranger talks with a mountaineer without realizing the man is actually Bigfoot. The Festrunk brothers meet up with their computer dates from Croatia. An ad for a new Swedish body floss promises to make hygiene fun. The Coneheads go on Family Feud and win by picking things that people bite. Steve gives tours of the homes of his close friends, but never actually goes inside. A panel discusses the possibilities of Napoleon possessing a B-52 bomber. The Dirt Band performs \"On the Loose With the Blues\" and \"White Russia\", and Randy Newman performs \"Short People\" and \"Rider in the Rain\".",

The X-police burst in on a couple for cohabitating, kill the girlfriend and frame the boyfriend for murder. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain reports on a nuclear-powered satellite that crashed into a Nova Scotia lobsterbed, and Roseanne Roseannadanna explains what an aneurysm is. Nick the lounge singer performs badly for a ski lodge. As the rest of the show continues, reports of monster lobsters start coming in, until the studio is overrun and by them and everyone killed. Bonnie Raitt performs \"Runaway\" and \"Give It All Up or Let Me Go\" (with Robert Klein).",

The skits for this episode are as follows: President Ford returns to give a rebuttal to Ronald Reagan's comments on the Suez Canal. Chevy Chase uses his opening monologue to milk the audience for applause. An ad pitches a new way to preserve moths by mashing them. A couple discusses what just happened after their one-night stand. During the Weekend Update, Chevy tricks Dan Aykroyd into giving him the anchor spot, and John Belushi gives a commentary on boxing that gets him so wound up he attacks Jane Curtain. A trainee customs inspector misses a pair of smugglers carrying cocaine. A priest of the Church of Confusion gives a sermon that rambles in circles. Two German soldiers behind enemy lines answer a series of baseball questions to prove they're actually American. For the final skit, several different endings are tried out. Billy Joel performs \"Only the Good Die Young\" and \"Just the Way You Are\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: During Art Garfunkel's opening monologue, one of the speakers goes out during his song, prompting John Belushi to come on stage and start ranting about the show getting short shrift from the network managers, then accuse Art of backstabbing when the singer wants to just brush off the mishap and try again without causing a fuss. Tom Snyder presents another installment of the Tomorrow show. The Nerds Todd DiLaMuca and Lisa Loopner talk about the books they like. John, as an elderly man, goes to the graveyard where all the other SNL cast members are buried and reminisces on how they died. Andy Kaufmann appears in his British Man character and begins reading from to the audience from The Great Gatsby, only to be met with heckling. Stephen Bishop performs \"On & On\" and Art Garfunkel performs \"All I Know\", Scarborough Fair\" and \"Crying In My Sleep\".",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Steve Martin (his fifth appearance), and the musical guest is The Blues Brothers (their second appearance). The skits for this episode are as follows: Concert promoter Don Kirschner presents footage of an old club performance by The Blues Brothers. For his opening monologue, Steve Martin talks about the inspiration for his comedy ideas, then does a magic act that ends with him tackling and beating a member of the audience. The Festrunk brothers prepare their apartment for the two girls they believe are on the way, but their neighbor Cliff tells them they've been stood up. Medieval doctor Theodoric of York treats a series of patients by draining their blood. A man and woman catch each other's notice in a crowded club, and dance together romantically as the rest of the club freezes in place around them. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain and Dan Aykroyd debate abortion, Jane reports on Carter's energy policy and a new nasal contraceptive, and Dan berates Garrett Morris for short-changing him on the weed he bought. Steve performs a song about King Tut. The Nerds Todd and Lisa prepare their science fair projects. The Blues Brothers perform \"I Don't Know\".",

During the Weekend Update, Dan Aykroyd rants about the NFL's new cheerleader uniforms, paying particular attention to the disgusting ways in which the outfits are designed to arouse male viewers.

The skits for this episode are as follows: Jane and Gilda run in panic when John comes on the set, thinking he's going to throw a tantrum after learning that his Deng Xiaoping act has been cut. Before Cicely Tyson can give her opening monologue, Garrett Morris comes out dressed as her because he think he's supposed to play all black roles, leading Cicely to berate him for throwing his talent away on degrading parts. Elvis Presley's coat continues to perform to sell-out crowds after its owner's death. The Widettes meet up with another family with similarly large backsides.

    "description": "The host for the episode is Kate Jackson, and the musical guest is Delbert McClinton. The skits for this episode are as follows: Network president Fred Silverman appears on Charlie's Angels where he reveals that he's a covert operative for ABC who has been deliberately sabotaging the network with terrible programming decisions, and then shares his plans with the angels for further damaging NBC's remaining popular shows. During Kate Jackson's monologue, she mentions that she used to be an NBC studio tour guide, and is then interrupted by a tour group passing through the studio. Lisa Loopner is upset to discover that Todd DiLaMuca has a crush on her mother's nurse. Fred Silverman reveals his new programming line-up, which includes giving more prime-time slots to McLean Stevenson and Tom Snyder, and having Rip Taylor anchor the evening news. During the Weekend Update, Roseanne Roseannadanna reports on the new King Tut exhibit, and Father Guido Sarducci talks about a UFO sighting. Andy Kaufman yodels while playing the bongos. When Kate tells Fred Silverman how dedicated and idealistic the rest of the SNL cast is, and how their principles are inspiring her to do more than just lowest-common-denominator television, Fred slaps her to bring her back to reality. Leonard Plinth-Garnell reviews bad cabaret for children. Mr. Bill takes up exercise, but gets pounded by his trainer, Sluggo. The Coneheads go to the movies, but Beldar freaks out after another moviegoer passes him a joint. Delbert McClinton performs \"B Movie Box Car Blues\" and \"Talkin' About You\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: When John Belushi is peeved that Gary Busey has been nominated for an Oscar, Gary tries to make amends. During his opening monologue, Gary performs a percussion solo, using his body as the drum kit. President Carter reluctantly agrees to his mother's request to take Billy along to the Middle East, where the first brother still manages to cause a mess. A group of guys in leisure suits discuss their solutions to various women's issues. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain reports on the Mid-East peace talks, the Voyager spacecraft, and seal hunting in Canada, while Bill Murray tries with little success to interview the widow of Mr. Ed. Honker dreams of someday getting the chance to perform Shakespeare. Gary Busey performs \"Stay All Night\" with Rich Danko and Paul Butterfield, and Eubie Blake performs \"Low Down Blues\", \"I'm Just Simply Full of Jazz\" and \"I'm Just Wild About Harry\" together with Gregory Hines.",

The skits for this episode are as follows: DJ Dick Lankey broadcasts from Doyle's Tavern for St. Patrick's Day, where Mayor Daley's ghost is supposed to reappear. Margot Kidder's opening monologue is interrupted by technical difficulties when the entire camera crew gets completely drunk. An ad for the navy shows sailors scrubbing floors, working in the mess hall and sitting around watching TV. A female bank executive on a business trip finds that her company has arranged for a male prostitute to spend the night with her. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain reports on Richard Nixon's grandson and a monkey shortage in medical research, Bill Murray wishes a happy hundredth birthday to Albert Einstein, Father Guido Sarducci vents about favoritism regarding American and Irish saints, and Jane and Dan debate Lee Marvin's palimony case. Superman and Lois Lane, now married, are having a party, but when Superman changes into Clark Kent, Lois confesses to him that she's been unfaithful. Al Franken complains that his face and name are being used to sell FrankenBerry cereal, and then tries to drum up sympathy for a sick homeless man. A group of women discuss the problems with men. Mr. Bill tries to hide when Mr. Hands comes to take him bowling, but he ends up getting crushed under a bowling ball. The Chieftans perform \"If I Had Maggie in the Woods\" and \"Morning Dew\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: At Two Mile Island Nuclear Power plant, a worker accidentally spills a soft drink on the control panel, causing a massive leak of radiation. When President Carter goes to investigate the situation, he insists that his background in nuclear engineering qualifies him to enter the reactor chamber, exposing him to a dose of radiation that causes him to grow to nearly one hundred feet tall. Todd DiLaMuca borrows his older brother's apartment in the hopes of putting the moves on Lisa Loopner. Other skits include a scene at a Scottish restaurant and a 'Bird for All Seasons', as well as a re-run of the Little Chocolate Donuts advertisement. Rickie Lee Jones performs \"Chuck E's in Love\" and \"Coolsville\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: Ray the telepsychic answers questions from callers to his cable TV show and gives advice on home repairs, marital infidelity and lost relatives. An ad for the navy presents some of the less glamorous jobs it entails. Idi Amin shows up as someone's house guest. A Roach brothel attracts insects even better than a roach motel. Nick the lounge singer performs at the TransEastern. Dolly Parton speaks to a group of Veterans of Foreign Hairdos. Mr. Bill and Spot get beaten and abused by Mr. Hands and Sluggo. Linda Rondtadt and Phoebe Snow perform \"It's In His Kiss\" and \"The Married Men\" together.",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Buck Henry (his eighth appearance), and the musical guest is Bette Midler. The skits for this episode are as follows: Mr. Bill goes to Rockefeller Center to see SNL, and almost gets to say the opening announcement. When Jane Curtain throws a tantrum in the control room because she's been passed over yet again to announce the show, John Belushi offers his support, but then steals the line out from under her. For his opening monologue, Buck Henry introduces some members of the audience who are taking part in an experiment to judge the quality of the show: as they gain or lose interest, the screen will shrink or grow in size. As Buck tries to engage the audience in intelligent matters, the picture soon begins to disappear, so he quickly switches to talking about sex. An entrepreneur combines three fun activities with his roller disco fishing park. The samurai baker provides a frantic man with a last-minute wedding cake. After watching the film Blind Ambition, Nixon tries to explain to his family that everything on the tapes was taken out of context because he and his staff were just joking around. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain and Bill Murray report on the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident, NBC's new logo design, and the recent Canadian elections, Garrett Morris comments on the racial overtones of a recent Rolling Stones song, and Roseanne Roseannadanna starts talking about the gas shortage but wanders into a story about Jane's behavior at the beach. Uncle Roy shows up to babysit and convinces the girls to tie him up and stuff their socks in his mouth. The Olympia diner has burned down, but the owner is hoping to make a profit from the insurance payment. Joan Face interviews a pair of transsexuals who donated the necessary parts to each other. For the closing, Michael O'Donoghue does an impersonation of Elvis with needles through his eyes. Bette Midler performs \"Married Men\" and \"Martha\".",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Steve Martin (his seventh appearance), and the musical guest is Blondie. The skits for this episode are as follows: The Pope makes an appearance at the Monsterdome, where his security staff has to keep the religious hangers-on from crashing the event. For his opening monologue, Steve Martin talks about his new fashion job, then gets angry at the band when they start an unexpected song. An ad pitches the benefits of Craig's Travelers Checks. A Roman Centurion faces a tribe of vandals who egg the soldiers, TP the camp, and have pizzas delivered to the general's tent. Steve pitches a product that allows him to hover over dirty toilet seats. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain and Bill Murray report on the Republican nominees for the 1980 election, a recall of General Motors cars, Fidel Castro's visit to America, and Mayor Koch's plan to publicizes prostitutes and johns, while Father Guido Sarducci talks about the excitement surrounding the Pope's visit to America. Don Kirshner presents another great moment in rock history: Carol King performing \"You've Got a Friend\" while her friend is being mugged outside her apartment. Mr. Bill tries to do a show without Mr. Hands, but his ex-partner crashes the show anyway. Two tourists stare in amazement at the audience, wondering 'what is that thing?' Blondie performs \"Dreaming\" and \"The Hardest Part\".",

During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain reports on the retirement of AFL-CIO leader George Meany, as well as investigations into embezzlement by the boss of the longshoremen's union, while Dr. Franken conducts experiments that mainly involve tearing apart cockroaches. Tom Clay of SaveCo offers viewers great deals on products that had to be rejected from stores for failing government safety inspections. Mr. Bill attempts to build a house for himself and Spot, but Mr. Hands and Sluggo smash him to pieces. Other skits include A Soviet takeover, Aunt Judy's basement, First He Cries, Woman to Woman, a rock opera preview, and Los Beatolos Cubanos.

The skits for this episode are as follows: Rodney Dangerfield tries to get ready for the show but finds that Father Guido Sarducci is using his dressing room to sleep in. During his opening monologue, Rodney discusses the lack of respect he gets in his sex life and his childhood. At a sperm bank, all the customers want their children fathered by Rodney, but the donor is having a hard time keeping up with demand. During the Weekend Update, Jane Curtain reports on President Carter's foreign policy gaffes and the FDA's ruling on artificial sweeteners, Bill Murray reports on a suppressed 60 Minutes report and Muhammad Ali's latest bout, then scolds Jerry Mathers for spreading rumors that he died in Vietnam. A substitute judge takes over a courtroom for a day, but finds that everyone is more interested in tricking him into letting them goof off. The J. Geils Band performs \"Love Stinks\" and \"Sanctuary\".",

The skits for this episode are as follows: For the hundredth episode, Garrett Morris holds a séance backstage to contact the spirits of the departed, and instead finds John Belushi, who is annoyed at being called in to do such a bit part. Bill Murray sings about how much he loves living in New York. The Horizon Television advertises itself as the biggest TV ever, though the screen is still just 12 inches. Sean the Leprechaun keeps getting caught by treasure-seekers because he's as big as a regular person. Todd DiLaMuca attempts to run for class president, but a smear campaign by his rival derails his hopes. During the Weekend Update, Bill Murray reports on the Ayatollah's hat-buying habits, Jane Curtain reports a false story about Walter Cronkite in the hopes of getting a date with him, and Roseanna Roseannadanna starts talking about breastfeeding but gets sidetracked about Bo Derek's nose hair. The Minstrels of Newcastle prepare for a performance but the drummer cant get the beat right. James Taylor & Paul Simon perform \"Cathy's Clown\", \"Sunny Skies\" and \"Take Me to the Mardi Gras. David Sanborn performs \"Anything You Want\".",

For his opening monologue, Steve Martin talks about what he believes in. A group of prehistoric hominids discusses the day's hunt, but the leader gets angry when a strange one starts coming up with new ideas that challenge his authority. Father Guido Sarducci finally manages to wake up Paul and Linda McCartney, who agree do give an interview despite the fact that it's five in the morning and Sarducci only wants to talk about marijuana.

    "description": "The host for the episode is Elliott Gould (his sixth appearance), and the musical guest is Kid Creole & The Coconuts. The skits for this episode are as follows: Elliott Gould wakes up in bed with the rest of the cast, and tells them what it was like working with the old SNL team. For his opening monologue, Eliott starts showing some of his old underwear to the audience, and ends up trading lingerie with Denny Dillon. To help educate Americans in their cars, a new program puts works of classic literature on billboards along the highways. After President Carter loses the 1980 election, Rosalyn tells him that now he's free to do whatever he wants. A couple receives a singing billy-gram from the woman's disapproving parents. A topless spokeswoman for the American Cancer Association demonstrates how to self-examine for breast cancer. During the Weekend Update, Charles Rocket reports on Ronald Reagan's planned appointments to his cabinet and proposed budget measures, Gail Matthius tries to inform John Anderson that he lost the election, and Ron Grosscup explains his theory that Reagan actually died several months earlier and has been replaced with a stand-in. For the Rocket Report, Charles attempts to get an interview with John Lennon, but instead starts investigating the state of trash collection in the neighborhood. A sergeant explains some of the new training measures being adopted now that homosexuals are allowed in the military. A stockbroker in his forties awkwardly tries to have a date with a teen-age valley girl. As a complement to speed reading, a new education service offers viewers the chance to learn speed listening. Kid Creole and the Coconuts perform \"Mister Softee\".",

A spokesman for American tobacco growers explains that lung cancer is actually caused by the lungs themselves, and not by smoking. Two British nobles develop the sport of serf-riding.

    "description": "The host for the episode is Bill Murray, and the musical guest is Delbert McClinton (his second appearance). The skits for this episode are as follows: Before the show, the entire cast goes to Bill Murray's dressing room to share their anxieties. He gives them a pep talk about how ratings aren't all that important. During his opening monologue, Bill grabs a woman from the audience and has to be restrained by Eddie Murphy. Jersey Guy Paulie Herman praises the chemical industry. Walter Cronkite tries sensory deprivation and goes on a psychedelic trip. A scientist shows off his photos of DNA molecules. Lounge singer Nick performs for Mardi Gras party-goers on a Mississippi riverboat. A sports reporter suggests the use of softer sticks to tone down hockey violence. Bill makes his Oscar picks, all of which happen to be for films starring the original cast. A man with unusual tastes goes into a flower shop. A couple go to a house party but are put at a loss when they can't remember the name of their host's cat. During the good-nights, Bill apologizes to his former cast-mates. Delbert McClinton and Bonnie Bramlett perform \"Givin' It Up For Your Love\" and \"Shotgun Rider\".",

While at her father's funeral, a woman has to deal with selfish and insensitive relatives, followed by an old one-night stand who won't leave her alone. Christine Ebersol, the wife of producer Dick Ebersol, asks viewers to send in their home movies, then introduces a film about John Lennon produced by Yoko Ono.",

The skits for this episode are as follows: For President Reagan's birthday, Frank Sinatra performs a medley of songs about him, Nancy, and the rest of his staff. An elderly couple lets a young boy talk on the phone with his mother, then demands she pay $50,000 to them if she ever wants her son back. Tim takes his family to Disney World, only to catch his wife, Madge the chimpanzee, in bed having an affair with a gas station attendant. Mr. Robinson introduces more people in his neighborhood while trying to avoid his landlord. Jerry Falwell pitches an album of Jesus-themed rock and pop songs. Christine Ebersole is excited about her date with James Coburn, but fellow cast member Mary Gross points out some of the tell-tale signs that James is gay. Dan Rather interviews some of the victims of 60 Minutes. Other skits include unique perspectives, the Taboosters and 'Don't Let It Show'. Lindsey Buckingham performs \"Bwana\" and \"Trouble\".",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Johnny Cash, and the musical guest is Elton John. The skits for this episode are as follows: Andy Rooney stars as Ralph Kramden in an episode of The Honeymooners, doing his usual observational monologuing. When a condemned prisoner insists on his right to a final request just before execution, he gets Johnny Cash to sing \"99,999 Bottles of Beer on the Wall\". After coming back from another tropical vacation, Reagan opens up a dialog over the Falklands between Thatcher and Galtieri by having them act out a love scene together. Two women test their hair for dandruff by shaking it over Johnny Cash. A wandering poet muses on the beauty of the commuter train he's riding, but the other passengers don't share his enthusiasm. Johnny Cash performs \"Ring Of Fire\", \"Folsom Prison Blues\", \"I Walk The Line\" and \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\". Elton John performs \"Empty Garden\" and \"Ball And Chain\".",

    "description": "The host for the episode is Chevy Chase (his third appearance as host), and the musical guest is Queen. The skits for this episode are as follows: Chevy Chase announces from a TV screen that because of a missed flight, he will have to host the show via satellite from California. He prepares to begin the first skit, but a stagehand accidentally knocks over his TV. For his opening monologue, Chevy speaks from a broken TV at the foot of the stage. Angry young artist and poet Tyrone Green displays his hatred of white people through his art at a gallery packed with white art connoisseurs. Joe Piscopo confesses his love for Rose Kennedy and asks her to marry him. John Hinckley announces his campaign for the presidency from his hospital cell. A mystery show presents a scene about a woman being accosted by a land shark that turns out to be on a video screen. Inventor Ron Popiel presents the Galactic Prophylactic, made of rubber and steel and guaranteed to last for fifty years. David Letterman presents a film shot by his dog and interviews Gumby. For the Weekend Update, Brad Hall reports on Reagan sending the Maureens to Lebanon, the NFL player's strike, and a new celebrity sperm bank, then phones up Secretary of the Interior James Watt to insult him. Father Andrew Titus angrily criticizes the new Reader's Digest condensed bible. Chevy claims to be reporting live from Beirut, but is revealed to be on the set of The Tonight Show in Burbank. An expose takes a serious look at a young man addicted to video games. Siskel and Ebert review the episode already in progress, praising Eddie Murphy but skewering Chevy. PTC Club prophet April May June praises Jesus while a faith healer performs miracles in the audience. Queen performs \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" and \"Under Pressure\".",

    "description": "William Shatner hosts this episode, and Lone Justice and Buster Poindexter are musical guests. The cold opener is a parody of \"The Green Berets\" involving former Colonel Oliver North(Shatner). William Shatner's \"infamous\" monologue involves his first attendance at a recent Star Trek convention, where he tells Trekkies to get a life. Liz Sweeney (Nora Dunn) sings a medley for her fiancé (Shatner), with her sister Candy. T.J. Hooker (Shatner) spend too much time riding the hood of a car during a chase. Weekend Update with Dennis Miller includes Al Franken experiencing phantom pains while describing Reagan's prostate surgery. Another Star Trek parody involves Captain Kirk (Shatner) and company converting the Enterprise into a space-based restaurant. A woman's(Dunn) Husband (Shatner) can't get enough of his physique in the mirror. In Kevin Nealon's Classic Christmas Experience, Nealon recalls Christmas clichés and disasters. The famous Lost Ending to \"It's A Wonderful Life,\" where the people of Bedford Falls rise up and kick Mr. Potter's (Jon Lovitz) ass. \"The True Life Story of Frankie Toussaint:\" A Schiller-Vision noir-film about a guy(Griffin Dunne), who just can't get a break from the justice system. Lone Justice performs the songs \"Shelter,\" and \"I Found Love,\" and for the holidays, Buster Poindexter sings \"Zat You, Santa?\"",

    "description": "John Travolta is the host and Seal is the musical guest. The cold opener contains Travolta walking to the SNL studios and desperately trying to get away from the theme from \"Saturday Night Fever,\" as it follows him everywhere he goes. During his monologue, he tries to push his latest film \"Pulp Fiction\" while somewhat cleverly hiding references to his past work. A woman(Janeane Garofalo) in a commercial pitching the latest plumbing product; \"Bathroom Monkey.\" On \"Coffee Talk,\" Linda Richman's latest guest is a man(Travolta) who takes his Barbara Striesand impersonations a little too far... and oddly, she's okay with that. Dracula(Travolta, again) invites a young couple into his castle, spends half the night trying to disprove their assumptions that he's gay with disastrous results. Two Guys from a Religious Cult(David Spade & Adam Sandler) do the weather on Weekend Update. Quentin Tarantino brings the Sweathogs to the big screen with his remake of \"Welcome Back, Kotter,\" adding a couple of surprise guests along the way. At a women's self-defense course, a mock-assailant(Chris Elliot) gets more than his fair share of crotch-kickings and other clobberings. Larry King interviews Marlon Brando(Travolta) from his Beverly Hills home after Brando was accused of anti-semitism for the second time. A boss keeps two of his workers who hate each other in a cramped office. A dope-dealing mob boss(Travolta) genuinely can't hear the insults and threats from his victims. Seal performs \"Prayer For the Dying\" and \"Crazy.\"",

    "description": "Sarah Jessica Parker hosts this episode and R.E.M. is the musical guest In the cold opening, Congressman Bob Hudnut (Chris Elliot) gives his concession speech, after losing his 1994 reelection Campaign. Sarah Jessica Parker's Monologue is a rewrite of \"Tomorrow\" tailored to Democrat election losses in Congress and the Senate. Commercial for Eterna-Rest coffins: Corpses rest with greater peace on more comfortable mattress. Brooklyn-based morning show \"Good Morning Brooklyn\" includes guests such as an up-and-coming actor named Angelo (Adam Sandler), and a free karate demonstration by James Barone(Jay Mohr). Nice & Naughty Guitarists tempt Parker with their own love ballads, both of which she shares duets with. Weekend Update with Norm MacDonald includes Gil Graham (Sandler) relating bad experiences at Led Zeppelin concert. Even Confucius (Chris Farley) can't satisfy fortune cookie maker (Mike Myers). Robert Evans(Michael McKean) hits on young wanna-be actress(Parker) on the Casting Couch. The Munchkins of Oz are less than appreciative of Dorothy's (Garofolo) accidental killing of Wicked Witch, despite Glinda the Good Witch's(Parker) insistence to the contrary. Bill Murray, delivers a eulogy for former SNL cast-member, writer, and producer Michael O'Donoghue along with an encore of \"Soiled Kimono\" skit. R.E.M. performs the songs \"What's The Frequency, Kenneth?,\" \"Bang & Blame,\" and \"I Don't Sleep, I Dream.\"",

In the cold opener, former Surgeon General Dr. Joycelyn Elders (Ellen Cleghorne) delivers a pro-masturbation speech upon her resignation. Alec Baldwin's Monologue involves a reaction to some complaints about a February 12, 1994 Canteen Boy sketch involving Baldwin and Adam Sandler, in which Baldwin played a child molester. Repeat of Lexon Paradox commercial spoof(See episode October 1, 1994). A Cop (Kevin Nealon) encounters a suburban family playing Santa Claus with their kids, only to find that they aren't really playing. Plastic surgeons (Baldwin, Chris Elliot, Janene Garafalo) save train wreck victims in the medical drama \"L.A. Breast & Penis.\" Larry Templeton (Chris Farley) is an unexpected and confused contestant of a Japanese Game Show. Another Weekend Update with Norm MacDonald. The mangled body of a gunshot victim causes a cavalcade of vomit in New York, in the police drama \"Rookie Cop.\" The soap opera parody \"The Young & The Youthful\" revolves around wealthy Pierce and his cognatively-challenged brother Petey (both played by Baldwin). Parents (Michael McKean, Garafalo) battle kids during a family road trip. A bride-to-be (Garafalo) takes an unsexy exotic dancer (Chris Elliot) to court, after being traumatized by his act during a bachelorette party. Auctioneers (Baldwin, Elliot) have stolen celebrity items on the block, including some owned by Christian Slater(Himself) who tries to get them back. Jack Handey's Deep Thoughts of the night involve the apparent beauty of jellyfish. The Beastie Boys perform the songs \"Sure Shot,\" \"Ricky's Theme\" & \"Heart-Attack Man.\"",

    "description": "Austrialian actor Hugh Jackman hosts this entertaining Christmas installment, with musical guest Mick Jagger. The \"cold opening\" features Will Farrell as George W. Bush, and Daryl Hammond as Al Gore speaking on the phone, as Gore hopes to negotiate possible new role for himself in the White House. Condy Rice and Dick Cheney listen bored, and Donald Rumsfeld eventually cuts the meeting short. In the opening monologue, after discarding other ideas, Hugh Jackman launches into a heartfelt rendition of \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,\" backed up by the ladies in the cast. Skits include \"Jared's Room,\" the web-cast from dread-locked Jimmy Fallon's dorm room, with Horatio Sanz as his stoner buddy, and Jackman as the nerd in the room next door. Jeff Richards as \"Drunk Girl\" makes a hilarious appearance on \"Weekend Update.\" Next Jackman plays a doll designer in \"Hello Dolly,\" where he presents some baby dolls doing unusual activities. Soon Jimmy Fallon and Mick Jagger square off through a mirror, as Fallon expertly imitates the rock icon as they both try to decide what moves to use on the program. Maya Rudolph aptly lampoons Donatella Versace, smoking in her bathtub as she interviews guests on her self-promoting show. Jackman plays a hot German male model (who's stayed with Donatella for eight months), and Mick Jagger does an expert Karl Lagerfeld. Lastly, Hugh Jackman recalls his Christmases in Australia, where a boxing kangaroo would visit each year. When Jackman's Dad, portrayed by Will Farrell, failed to best the kangaroo in a bout, the beast would take unfair advantage of the Dad in a rude way. Eventually, the young Jackman and his sister wonder if their Dad isn't purposely letting the kangaroo win.",

    "description": "This episode of April 2005 opens with Chris Parnell posing as beleaguered House of Representives Majority Leader Tom Delay. The opening credits roll and musical guest Beck and host Tom Brady are announced. Tom Brady soon takes the stage, and is soon joined by most of the cast to sing an outrageously egotistical song about himself. A fake commercial for an alternative to Viagra is show next. First skit then has Tom Brady at a carnival midway trying in vain to throw a football through a hole in the wall about six feet away. After that, Darryl Hammond impersonates Dr. Phil McGraw, and grills insensitive husband Tom Brady because he has no \"emotional intelligence.\" Next is an involved episode of \"The Falconer,\" which has the Falconer and Donald switching bodies. Tom Brady has a small part as a lost hiker. The TV funhouse segment is a mock industrial training film entitled \"Sexual Harassment And You.\" It is filmed in 1950's style, and features Fred Armisen and Tom Brady as office workers who know the wrong and correct ways to approach women in the workplace. Next, Tom Brady appears in a genie costume to promote \"Tom Brady's Falafal City,\" an Indian restaurant that he supposedly owns. Beck performs his first selection at this point. Following Beck is the \"Weekend Update,\" with Tina and Amy, who are joined by a surprise visit by Jiminy Glick, an alter-ego of Martin Short. Next obnoxious and hyperactive \"tween\" Caitlyn torments her step-dad and her \"Uncle Scott,\" played by Tom Brady. Then comes a fake episode of VH1's \"Behind the Music,\" detailing the phenomenon of the 1985 Chicago Bears and their hit, \"The Superbowl Shuffle. Tom Brady plays a head-banded Jim MacMahon. Another Beck performance comes at this point. The next skit features Maya Rudolph as a inebriated lounge singer, with Tom Brady accompanying her in a way not unlike Kenny G. The final skit has Tom Brady playing himself as he is challenged by Seth Meyers as Peyton Manning and Keenan Tompson as Donavon McNabb's mother. Lastly Tom Brady thanks Beck, the cast of SNL, and says goodnight.",

Larry King(Fred Armisen) interviews a group of trans-gendered people who are in the middle of their sex change procedures. TransAmerica star Felicity Huffman(Kristen Wiig) is one of his guests. In the third installment of The Needlers, Dan(Meyers) and Sally Needler(Amy Poehler) seek help from a fertility doctor(Portman) so they can have a baby as an alternative to examining the issue of their troubled marriage. TV Funhouse celebrates a belated Black History moment; 24's Dennis Haysbert(Himself) shows clips from all-black kids' cartoons that failed to make an impact during the 1990's. Nuni Schoener(Portman) brings her college boyfriend Jeff(Jason Sudeikis) home to meet her parents, Nonny(Armisen) and Nunni(Maya Rudolph). Weekend Update with Tina Fey & Amy Poehler includes Donald Trump(Hammond) disguising himself as Martha Stewart in order to pump his own ego over their \"Apprentice\" feud, Olympic skater Sasha Cohen(Portman) attempting a second career as a comedienne, and Kenan Thompson introducing a new clothing line geared toward black men in drag. Former \"Wake-Up Wakefield\" co-host Sheldon(Rachel Dratch) has a Bar-Mitzvah, and watches his short-term ex-girlfriend(Portman) make out with his friend Jonah(Andy Samberg), while Megan (Rudolph) dreams of marrying Adam Levine. This SNL Digital Short is a Chris Parnell interview with Natalie Portman, who raps about a side of herself we've never seen before. Repeat of the Totally Rad Smoke Detector 3000 commercial from episode airing October 29, 2005. Fall Out Boy performs \"Dance Dance\" and \"Sugar, We're Going Down.\"",

    "description": "Shia LaBeouf hosts this episode, and My Morning Jacket is the musical guest. In the cold opener, Hillary Clinton (Amy Poheler) vows to be a sore loser if she doesn't win the 2008 Democratic Primaries. LeBeouf's monologue involves surprise visits from characters of past Indiana Jones movies. MacGruber's(Will Forte's) son comes out of the closet during an attempt to diffuse a bomb. A parody of 70's game show \"Match Game\" goes wrong when the host is found murdered, and the panel are prime suspects. Hardcore inmate Lorenzo McIntosh (Kenan Thompson) tries to scare a trio of young punks out of a life of crime. Financial expert Suze Orman (Kristen Wiig) gives more advice. An SNL Digital Short encourages walking around without pants. On Weekend Update, Liberty City residents speak out against the negative portrayal of their community by the video game \"Grand Theft Auto IV.\" A Spanish-speaking television reporter interviews LaBeouf, and is convinced he was originally born female. Two young women go to a restaurant and get the attention of six lovestruck, creepy guys. A mother tries desperately to get her daughters to dress the way she thinks typical stylish New Yorkers do.",

Mick Jagger hosts: he plays a movie action hero who discloses his real personality on a game show, a London economist speaking for J.P. Morgan in an interview with Al Sharpton, an insurance agent reluctant to sing karaoke, a dad on a soap opera, Steven Tyler as a TV host and a pitchman, and an M.C. at graduation. The digital short is \"Lazy Sunday 2.\" Jagger sings with Arcade Fire, the Foo Fighters, and Jeff Beck. Cameos are plentiful, and the spotlight is on Kristen Wiig in her final appearance as a regular cast member.",
