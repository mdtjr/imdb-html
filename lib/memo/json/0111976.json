After they have gone to work he spends his day enacting scenes from films, ordering pizza and watching his home made videos, which Mandy has sabotaged. Later Mandy returns from work to find him in her bed wearing only her panties and blackmails into letting her off her rent arrears if she keeps quiet about it. After Matthew is freaked out by an overly amiable gay friend of Mandy's she likens their situation to that of the characters in the Jean-Paul Sartre work' Huis Clos.'",

In the evening he threatens to evict Mandy but she tells him she will probably be leaving anyway, having met a millionaire who has offered her a job in Bermuda. She returns from her date to tell Martin she thinks the man was a liar who got drunk and passed out. Martin confesses his own insecurity but they are interrupted by a paranoid Matthew who accuses them of plotting against him and tells them to leave immediately.

He sees himself as a Rock God and considers raising the tenants' rents for the privilege of knowing him. However when the band is called upon to perform a gig at very short notice the mere act of having to leave the flat increases his agoraphobic terror and he merely moans and whimpers whilst on stage. Nonetheless rock magazine The Dog's Bollocks believes this to be a perfect interpretation of post-Modernist pain and praises his non-performance.",

    "description": "Martin is still pining for Clare, having written a novel about her and the others charge him money each time he mentions her name. Matthew has had cards printed advertising himself as a palm reader though his agoraphobia precludes any customers and the one female visitor to the flat, Tess Freeman, whom he wrongly believes to be a transsexual, is actually a debt collector chasing Mandy for the £9,000 pounds she owes on her credit cards. Fortunately Mandy's gentlemanly new boss Archie has taken a shine to her and gives her an interest-free loan to pay off the debt.",
