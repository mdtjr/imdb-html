    "description": "It's the summer of 1932, and the Depression is taking its toll on the people of Ontario. Jack and Honey Bailey own a hardware store in North Bridge, and Jack, understanding the hardships of the townsfolk, provides credit to whoever needs it, which seems to be everybody. Honey is a little more business oriented with their customers, but that does not prevent the hardware store from going under and the Baileys declaring bankruptcy. Honey's brother, Joe Callaghan, is not of much assistance to his sister's family as he too is just scraping by running his rooming house; he has often needed to live off his sister. Jack and Honey feel they have no choice but to ask Jack's family for support. Offered by Jack's mother, Jack and Honey with their brood - pre-teens Hubert (known as Hub), Henry (known as Fat) and infant Violet - decide to move to Jack's hometown of New Bedford to live in the abandoned Bailey family summer house located just outside of town at Bass Lake. New Bedford, a mining town, was founded by the Bailey family when they struck a lode of silver forty years earlier. To this day, the Baileys still control what happens in New Bedford. The Bailey family is ruled by its stern, no-nonsense and traditional matriarch, May - Jack's mother - who still owns Silver Dome mine. Jack's two siblings also still live in New Bedford: eldest son Bob (with his wife Toppy and daughter Doris) who, with an air of superiority, heads the administration of the mining company, and younger sister Grace, the sheltered spinster who still lives at home. Jack and Honey are not looking forward to life in New Bedford as they have no job prospects (Jack wants nothing to do with the mine), Jack has always been the black sheep of the family, and May has never liked Honey primarily due to religious differences, the Baileys being stout Presbyterians and the Callaghans being Catholic. Jack and Honey are raising their children Catholic. Distance and time has not healed the rifts between Jack/Honey and the Baileys of New Bedford. Disaster strikes when shortly after their arrival at Bass Lake, Jack is killed in a freak accident. Beyond mutual mourning and grief, May offers no support to her impoverished daughter-in-law - which includes kicking her out of the summer house - as the two no longer have any formal ties. However, May wants to keep heirs Hub and Fat - Violet is to live with Jack's childless cousin - while Honey re-establishes her life. Honey doesn't agree with this arrangement but has neither the energy or means to fight the powerful May Bailey. Honey's sole ally in the Bailey family is Grace. Reluctantly, Honey agrees to the situation - to which her sons are angry - as she goes back to North Bridge with Joe to earn enough to bring her family together again under one roof.",

    "description": "In North Bridge, Honey and Joe are just scraping by. Honey can't find a job but is determined if only for the sake of her family. But she is no where near able yet to reunite her family. In New Bedford, May admits that she sees the arrangement with all three children as being permanent, never giving Honey the children ever again. Despite warming up to their Aunt Grace who personally can relate to the boys' situation, Hub and Fat are rebellious and Hub in particular is defiant. Bob thinks that splitting up the boys would be the best solution, but May is equally adamant that she and Grace can manage the boys. The boys decide to run off, their first choice being back to North Bridge to be with their mother. But when opportunity shows itself, they stow away a ride back to the summer house at Bass Lake. When May and Grace first find that the boys are missing, May is inclined to think that Honey apprehended them. Not wanting to give Bob the satisfaction of an 'I told you so', May instead sends a nervous and timid Grace to North Bridge to confront Honey. When Grace meets with Honey and finds that the boys aren't there, Honey is livid with May about her sons' disappearance. At the lake, the boys manage temporarily to live in the house unnoticed, until Max Sutton, New Bedford School's athletics director, runs into them. News of 'boys' at the house gets back to May, who rushes out to the lake. Max, May and mill workers from across the lake all descend on the house simultaneously just in time as Hub has had a serious accident requiring immediate medical attention and the boys have started a large uncontrolled fire in the house. May comes to the realization that the boys emotionally do need their mother and that Honey is not quite the monster she thought. May decides the best for everyone is for the boys to have bi-weekly visits with their mother and Uncle Joe back in North Bridge.",

    "description": "Honey's financial fortunes take a turn for the better as she finally gets a job, albeit a poorly paying one, as a bookkeeper/clerk at Molloy's Grocery Store. Even the boys have a job as George Murphy, one of the mine managers, is going away on a much needed vacation and needs someone to look after his dog, Pal. Joe's fortunes are not as good. The bank is foreclosing on the mortgage on his rooming house. He wants to start a catalog business, but obviously the bank won't lend him the money. He tells Honey that he is selling the rooming house to finance the catalog business. But in reality, he has lost everything and unscrupulous financiers are after him, so Joe secretly leaves North Bridge, leaving Honey to fend for herself. But Joe's problems are not as desperate as the many hobos who are descending on New Bedford. The town is split, where some like Max and Grace, do whatever they can to help, whereas others like May and Bob, want the hobos just to leave town. May thinks her case is supported when she thinks a hobo, who appeared at her back step, stole her purse, she not believing his sob story about an ailing son. And a robbery occurs at the bank, again attributed to the transients. When a reward is offered for the return of the robbery money, Hub and Fat think they can find it by looking around the railway tracks where the hobos are hanging out. There, they meet Patrick Mullen, the hobo who was at May's back door. The boys and Patrick are involved in two incidents, the latter which results in a death, which may look like Patrick's fault. Although the boys ultimately defend Patrick to May and the authorities, both sides of the issue are still adamant on their position of what desperate hobos are capable. To protect Patrick, their savior, Hub and Fat tell Patrick and his ailing son, Luke, that it best to leave town, providing Patrick with a little pocket money. The boys also find what happened to May's purse, which needless to say was not stolen by Patrick.",

    "description": "Honey's economic fortunes again take a turn for the worse. The bank is increasing the rent on the apartment, and she loses her job at Molloy's Grocery Store. She is thinking of moving to faraway Toronto, where she suspects there are more jobs than in North Bridge. She needs the company of her children now more than ever. However May is threatening to decrease the boys' visits to North Bridge to once a month, in part because she wants to shield escort Grace from the company of a high school beau, Judd Wainwright, with whom Grace got reacquainted on the bus trip and who May never liked. And since Grace doesn't know how to drive, there is no other means of transport. May's effort to teach Grace to drive was a disaster, the lesson which resulted in a car crash requiring extensive and expensive repairs to May's car, and May landing in the hospital for an extended stay with a concussion. The boys, wanting more than ever to be with their mother, try to earn enough money for it to happen. They think they've come up with the perfect plan when Max is threatened by the school board with cutting of the athletics program: they should hold an intercity Boys Olympics sponsored by local businesses, including the newspaper - the New Bedford Chronicle - owned by Alden Cramp. The showcase of the Olympics is to be the 12-boy human pyramid, the winning team who will split a $60 first prize. Hub and Fat are certain the New Bedford team can win. The boys' training goes up and down, but ultimately it looks as if the New Bedford team has a real shot of winning. On the weekend of the Olympics, Honey is in desperate need of her boys' company to maintain a positive outlook on life. Although the boys initially aren't going to go to North Bridge due to the need for last minute training, they feel they need to support their mother more. With no other way to get there, Grace decides to drive. With Judd's assistance, they make it to North Bridge in one piece. Seeing how financially desperate Honey is, Grace decides that the $25 for the car repairs would better go to Honey. Although the $25 is May's money, Grace will deal with the consequences of May's wrath later. But the next issue is to make it back to New Bedford in time for the Olympics, which is a problem as Grace is directionally and speed challenged, not to mention that she has no idea what the \"E\" and \"F\" on the car's fuel gauge means. Regardless of if the boys make it back in time, the Olympics end up having a positive effect on Max, the boys and the school board, the latter who was initially skeptical of the whole event.",

    "description": "The boys, especially Fat, are getting emotionally attached to Pal. Fat even wants to keep him. May, on the other hand, is totally exasperated by Pal's antics. It gets worse for May when George Murphy is tied up on his vacation, which he needs to extend by two weeks. Since the boys are starting school and May does not want to look after the dog, the Baileys make arrangements with Max to look after Pal for the additional two weeks. This new arrangement does not stop Pal from wandering back to the Bailey household and his friends, Fat and Hub. Pal's latest antics start a war between Fat - and by extension all those in the Bailey household - and May's neighbors, the Grady's. Although Dottie Grady initiated the argument by demeaning Honey to Fat, Fat escalated it. May demands that Fat apologize to Dottie Grady, in front of a meeting of the Daughters of the Order of the Empire, which he eventually but reluctantly does. The over-the-top apology is not sincere, but so theatrical that Dottie Grady has no other option but to accept. This apology does not stop the war between neighbors as two of the Grady's chicken are found dead, which the Grady's attribute to Pal. Although Pal could not have done it - in reality, it was a neighborhood fox that did the deed - the Grady's do not accept that anyone or anything else could have killed their chickens other than Pal. Immediately following, Pal is found shot to death. Although Alastair Grady denies killing Pal, May exposes Alastair for the hypocrite that he is.",

    "description": "Honey has moved to Toronto in the prospect of a job. She manages to get work in a garment factory as a seamstress, but the hours are long and the conditions harsh. Because of the conditions and being worn out, Honey comes down with a chest infection and is fired from work. She is more destitute as, still sick, the hospital won't let her stay since she can't pay. Back in New Bedford, everyone is unaware of Honey's situation. May thinks that it would be good for Hub to learn some responsibility and as such Bob gets him a job on Wick Thompson's farm on weekends doing haying. It is also long hours. There, he bunks with Harry Bloomington, an older Englishman who keeps to himself during their off hours. Harry mentors Hub, who enjoys the cooperative nature of a farmer's family life. When the farm goes under, Hub learns about humility and fairness from Wick and Harry. And Fat also gets a temporary job, in a Chatauqua show passing through New Bedford. Fat loves the life of being on stage, seeing Brambly Wilson, the show's star, as to what he would like to aspire. But Fat learns that Brambly is a regular human being, affected by the Depression as much as the next guy. Meanwhile, Grace learns of Honey's situation and tries to convince May that Honey's presence is the best thing for the life of Hub and Fat.",

    "description": "Honey is back in New Bedford, living in May's house with the boys, and working in the mine office under Bob's supervision. On the invitation of Honey's co-worker, Marjorie Behan, Honey joins Marjorie's informal social grouping of single friends. Not specifically looking for a new man in her life, Honey nonetheless attracts the attention of a couple of men. The one who seems to have her initial affections is Percy Ardley, a constable with the New Bedford Police Department. Percy is a proper Englishman with, to use Fat's description, a swelled head. Most of the men in the singles group, including Max and Archie, have the same impression of Percy as they don't much care for him. Marjorie, slightly jealous, warns Honey that if she is looking for a new husband, Percy is not the man for her as he is a wanderer, and as such is not stable as husband material. May and the rest of the Baileys aren't too happy with what they see as Honey's cavorting as they feel it is demeaning to the Bailey name and improper to the memory of Jack. It isn't until Hub and Fat get into a predicament with a crazed moonshiner, Old Bones, that Honey sees the pompous, arrogant side of Percy that others see. Perhaps the other man who is vying for Honey's attention, that being Max, might now have an opportunity with her. The fact that he broke the law for her to help save Hub and Fat is a point in his favor.",

    "description": "Max, the new English teacher and aspiring playwright, is encouraged by Honey and Grace to submit a one-act play to National Public Radio for their serialized mystery program with the chance of winning one of three prizes of a new Packard. Although Max does not win, he gets an encouraging rejection letter asking for more submissions from him for one-act plays. Since the rejection was due to what the radio station characterized as wooden dialog, Honey and Grace think that Max would benefit by having his play actually performed on stage so that he can listen to real people speaking his words. The obvious choice for the theater company to perform the play is the New Bedford Amateur Dramatic League. However, the League is no longer in existence, and they would have to ask the former president to resurrect the company. This situation causes a potential problem as the former president is snobbish Toppy, who has no use for Honey. But a good play and the stage is more important to Toppy than her feelings toward her former sister-in-law. The play is to be directed by Max but realistically it is run by Toppy as League president. And as League president, Toppy insists on playing the lead. Toppy feels that she can relate to the character's stifled existence - at home, Toppy is being ignored while at the same time controlled by a preoccupied-with-work Bob, who at the best of times is wary of Toppy's frivolous activities - despite the character being twenty-something, while Toppy, who will not admit to the world, is forty-something. The production has other problems, including a temperamental set designer, a temperamental costumer, a stage shy leading man (Archie) and love scenes between the leads, Toppy who is a respectable wife whose husband, Bob, would be embarrassed and humiliated by his wife kissing another man in public. The on-stage romance seems to be spilling into real life, which is at least opening Archie out of his shell, but it gets the whole town's collective tongue wagging. The only tongue not wagging is that of Bob, who is oblivious to what's going on since he's concerned about business. However, when Bob finally sees the show and sees his wife kissing another man so realistically, Toppy doesn't get the reaction that everyone was anticipating. As for the original reason for mounting the production, Max may not have got what he intended but at least he got to spend time with Honey.",

    "description": "May's latest town project is opening a mission to assist the down and out in New Bedford. This worthwhile project does have its detractors, such as Max, as the mission is only available to townsfolk and not to the many transients passing through town. And as the mission is reaping all the town's donations, Max's soup kitchen for the transients is no longer getting any donations. Meanwhile, Grace is invited on her first official date with Judd Wainwright, to a mutual friend's out-of-town wedding. Grace so wants to go but doesn't want to tell her mother the reason why she wants to go so badly. May won't let her go only because she needs Grace's help at the mission. But May, who still doesn't approve of Judd solely based on his financial standing, suspects Grace's desire to go is because of Judd, this suspicion based on family gossip Toppy's information. Although Grace tries to tell her mother the truth, May as usual doesn't budge in her feelings. May has her eye on Reverend Peterson as a suitor for Grace, Reverend Peterson who does not appeal to Grace as a potential husband at all. As such, Grace - with accomplices Honey, Max, Hub and Fat - deceives May so that she can sneak away with Judd to the wedding. Just as Grace and Judd board the train, May catches them. Grace decides to board the train anyway, this probably the first act of direct defiance ever against her mother. This is only the first of two heartbreaking events for May, as some hobos, retaliating against May for her lack of charity, vandalize the mission just before its opening. But the heartbreaking incidents give time for May to think about her actions, just in time for apologies from Grace and Judd, and a hopeful question from Judd to May.",

    "description": "Joe Callaghan, Honey's brother, makes an inauspicious return to New Bedford. He is now totally down and out. In the six months since Joe absconded with Honey's savings - six months in which Honey has not heard from him - he has dabbled in various businesses, some legitimate and some not so legitimate, but none that has panned out. Although May helps Joe get out of the New Bedford jail after an altercation with Sergeant Stoneman, she treats him like any other hobo and wants him to leave town. However Joe has other ideas. He wants to be with family and has holed up in an empty farmhouse on the outskirts of town. He wants himself and Honey to buy the house, which only requires a $50 down payment. Although Honey doesn't trust Joe, she does buy into the dream so that she can be out from under May's control, the dream which includes getting Violet back. Honey seems to be heading into the right direction financially when she stumbles upon a home hairdressing business, if only May will let her use her kitchen as a makeshift salon. Hub and Fat also do whatever they can to raise the money to buy the house, Fat's idea which actually results in a $10 windfall. However the $10 mistakenly gets to May who, unaware that it was for Honey, donates it to a needy family at the mission. Honey, Hub and Fat realize that the money is better with the family that received it. As May realizes that she also made an error, she decides to temporarily support Honey in her hairdressing business. Meanwhile, trouble has followed Joe to New Bedford, and to escape these troubles, Joe, with Hub's assistance, secretly leaves New Bedford as quickly as he came. However Honey continues Joe's dream of saving money to possibly buy that house.",

    "description": "Honey's birthday is approaching and the boys want to get her something special. Instead of a little knick-knack, what Hub thinks would be the best gift is a visit from Violet. This gift may prove to be difficult to get as May will not allow it. Hub, with Max's help, even drives the three hours to Hugh and Matilda's to convince them of such. Although Matilda eventually gives in, Hugh, Matilda and May obviously don't have any intention of giving Violet back to Honey beyond this visit. But for this visit, Hub and Fat need to raise some money for the round trip bus fare for Matilda and Violet. Coinciding with this event, May and her women's volunteer group are deciding on a fund-raising event for the mission. When Honey inadvertently contradicts May in front of the group, Honey is placed further in May's bad books as the group goes with Dottie Grady's idea of a bake sale rather than May's idea of a winter carnival. Although they do proceed with the bake sale idea, May goes behind the group's back to organize a winter carnival with Reverend Peterson. However, the Reverend has ideas of his own, which places May in an embarrassing and bad light: he embezzles and absconds with the mission's entire fund. Although May does replace all the embezzled moneys, she is ashamed to face the townsfolk, especially as she was the person who hired Reverend Peterson. The women, realizing they do need May's organizational and financial skills, extend a olive branch to her, which takes time for her to accept. The collective decide to combine the two ideas and have a street party. As part of this party, Fat is allowed to raise moneys, in part for the bus fare, by running a miniature snow golf course. The street party and the golf course are a success. Honey's surprise birthday party is also a success, except for the fact that Matilda, with May's approval, reneges on her agreement to bring Violet. But Grace takes matters into her own hands and does the next best thing for Honey under the circumstances.",

    "description": "Grace receives some devastating news for her ego. Judd has decided to call off the wedding, as he is moving west to British Columbia without her. He did not feel that he and the Bailey family were a good match. But Grace, feeling humiliated, decides not to tell anyone, and even buys herself an engagement ring to continue with the façade. Honey inadvertently gives Grace an idea of how to escape her troubles. Meanwhile, Hub, still continuing with his never-ending quest to earn money for the \"bring Violet home\" fund, lets this single-mindedness affect all else in his life. It affects his school work the most, and he fails the 6th grade. He asks Max not to tell Honey as he wants to tell her himself; Hub ends up not doing so. Hub's latest money making venture is with a band of older boys calling themselves the Midnight Movers. The Midnight Movers, likening themselves to Robin Hood, assist people in bilking their landlord of rent money. In these times, first month is free, the second month the renter tells the landlord he is on relief and the third month, the Midnight Movers help him move just before rent is due. What Hub does not know is that many of those he has helped move are in debt to his grandmother. After the many secrets are revealed one by one and after a serious incident involving Hub, May comes to the conclusion that the way she has managed the lives of her grandsons, Honey and even Grace and Jack may have been totally misconceived.",

    "description": "Despite May giving the boys her assurance that she will let Violet come back home, Honey and the boys continue with their preoccupation with the 'bring Violet back home' fund since they do not trust May to keep her word. In an effort to expand her hairdressing business, Honey decides to go to a 2-day course in North Bridge to get her hairdressing diploma. And Hub and Fat take more direct measures by going to speak to Mr. Walker, the bank manager, about a creative solution in buying the house. Hub's single-mindedness with getting Violet back continues as his school work still suffers, until another distraction enters his life, namely 8th grade tutor, Suzanne Nelson - Iris Barlow's niece - on who Hub has a crush. Honey also writes to Hugh and Matilda kindly thanking them for their guardianship of Violet but that she would like Violet home now. The reaction to this letter does reveal May and the Morrison's true plans, that the Morrisons want to adopt Violet and take her away to Florida, and May wants Honey around if only for her grand plans for the boys' future at the mine. Fat overhears the truth and with Suzanne's help, the boys manage to bring Violet back to New Bedford before the Morrisons can leave for Florida. This sparks an all out war between May and Honey, the latter - with all three of her children - who decides to leave May's house and life forever if possible. She turns to the only person she can, that being Max. However, Max is also on May's bad side and his future in New Bedford is uncertain. The arrival of Honey and her family on his doorstep worsens matters as scandal erupts in town. Honey is in financial straits again as Bob, in solidarity, fires her from the mine and none of her regular hairdressing customers will let her do their hair anymore in not wanting to go against May. Besides Max, the only other person in town on Honey's side is Grace, who openly defies her mother in every turn in this battle. May does whatever she can to thwart Honey's plans, and also decides to sue for custody of all three children. Before the custody hearing, Hub manages to tell his story in a straightforward and heartfelt manner to the town, which may turn the tide of public opinion toward Honey and her family.",

    "description": "Following the custody hearing, Honey is still living in the rooming house with all three of the children, and is still working at the laundry. Relations with May are tense, although Fat in particular misses his grandmother and May in return misses the children. Life at the mine office is not going well as in addition to some financial difficulties, Toppy is doing the bookkeeping, a task at which she is not very good. Grace, wanting a little independence, gets a job working as the town's telephone operator, replacing the retiring Hattie Olsen. Grace also catches the eye of Ollie Jefferson, although she says they are only friends. And Max, on May's maneuvering, is out of his teaching job, although he still has his announcing job at the radio station. Max is offered a teaching job in Albany, New York, and asks Honey to go with him as his wife. Despite a cold initial reception to the idea from both Hub and Fat, Honey's entire household does eventually agree that it is a good idea and the proposal is accepted. Grace is to be Honey's maid of honor, and Max's older brother Del - a railroad executive - is to be Max's best man. Fat tells his grandmother of the situation, May who is distraught that her grandchildren will be leaving New Bedford for good. May does whatever she can to keep Honey and the children in New Bedford, including offering Honey the house she wanted free and clear, and asking Bob to rehire Honey at the mine. Honey declines the house and Bob can't in good conscience offer Honey a job when he is cutting hours of existing employees. Although May and many on the school board don't really like Max, May figures the last card she can play is to get Max his job back at the school. Not only does the school board offer Max a job, but he is offered the Vice-Principalship. This offer is one that Max and Honey cannot refuse or decline, and they decide to stay in New Bedford. Beyond the job offer, May offers a small olive branch to Honey. Meanwhile, two secrets are kept hidden, one concerning May's health, and the other concerning the newly arrived Del Sutton, Honey and the boys who are the only people in town who know both secrets.",

    "description": "Things are not going well at the mine. To keep the company afloat, Bob needs to secure extended credit from the bank and lay off some workers, news to which they do not take too well. In addition, Toppy and Doris have left Bob. May realizes that she has left too much responsibility to Bob which in part has caused both his professional and personal problems. Meanwhile, things at the Sutton household are also not going well following Max and Honey's wedding. At Honey's apartment, there are now six people living in two rooms, the sixth person being Del, who has decided temporarily to stay in New Bedford. Hub and Fat have not taken to Max as their father; they try not to lose the memory of Jack as Max becomes a more integral part of their lives. Hub and Fat are having more fun with their Uncle Del, who, following losing his railway executive job, has reverted to a loose and carefree life, what some may call immaturity. With Grace's help, Del manages to get a job as a mechanic working for Ollie. But Del's secondary job is as a pool hustler, which works for him until he gets hustled himself. Beyond the issues with Hub and Fat, Max needs some peace and quiet to study for his university degree, without which he is out of the Vice-Principal job at the school. With the housing situation, Honey and Max decide to rent a 3-bedroom apartment in the New Bedford Hotel, the major selling point for Honey being that there is an abandoned hairdressing space just off the hotel lobby.",

    "description": "Everyone in town seems to be getting a new job. Hub is apprenticing with Ollie at the garage. Honey is opening her hair dressing salon. Callie is taking over responsibility for managing the radio station from Alden. And Grace, depressed at being recently fired from her telephone operator job, is asked by Max to manage his radio show - with Del and Fat's help - on this one specific occasion when he has a school board meeting in his new role as Vice-Principal. Grace had better do a good job as Callie is threatening to move Max's radio program to a less lucrative afternoon slot, a time when he would be unable to work at the station. During this particular show, Grace faces a crisis of possible dead air time when an act cancels at the last minute. On Del's suggestion, Grace reads an advice column on air to fill this time. Using a fake stage voice and the assumed name Dr. Veronica Love, Grace is embarrassed and ashamed of the job she did, but Dr. Love is a hit with the listeners. Callie wants to hire Dr. Love on an exclusive contract, even after she finds out the truth that Grace is Dr. Love. Callie even convinces Grace to do public appearances wearing a costume and wig. It isn't until Dr. Love dispenses advice to a love struck Ollie - Grace initially unaware that the letter is from Ollie and he is asking about advice on how to approach his unrequited love, that being Grace herself - that Grace realizes Dr. Love is no longer part of her future. But Grace devises another act to fill in Dr. Love's old time slot. Meanwhile, May's driver's license is suspended after she gets into a fender bender with a police car. Sergeant Stoneman, who considers May to be the worst driver in New Bedford, decides to put the fear in May with a mandatory driver's exam she needs to do to get her license back. But May surprises the sergeant with her diligence and response to his little prank.",

    "description": "After being closed for a year, the town's pawn shop reopens, this time by the actual owner of the property, Leo McGinty. May does not recognize Leo at first, but he was her husband John's old prospecting partner and John's competitor for May's affections. But Leo ran away from New Bedford forty years prior thinking that he had no chance with her. Although May does not know what would have happened between herself, Leo and John if Leo did not run off, May and Leo's reunion is one of keeping an emotional distance. Leo decided to move back to New Bedford to protect his twelve year old maternal granddaughter, Maisey, from life in the big city, Toronto. Maisey is a tomboy who isn't scared of anyone or anything. She and Leo don't get along much since she was emotionally close to her deceased mother, with whom Leo had a turbulent relationship. Maisey's mother was a saloon singer and pianist, the talent at the piano which she passed onto her daughter. After an auspicious introduction to the other kids in town, Maisey and the Bailey boys become fast friends, Hub in particular who tries to help Maisey achieve her goal of running away back to Toronto, where Maisey wants to earn a living playing the piano. But Leo really does love his granddaughter, a fact which she needs to hear.",

    "description": "It's nearing the end of summer 1933 and with it comes the annual Farewell to Summer Dance. The kids are planning on having a good time, with a friendly wager struck between partners Hub/Alice and Fat/Maisey on which couple will win the junior ballroom dance contest. Ollie is hoping to take Grace to the dance. Afraid that she still thinks of him only as a friend, Ollie enlists Del as his mentor in wooing Grace. Del ghost writes some romantic letters for Ollie to Grace, which she loves. Things are not going as well for Bob. Toppy, with Doris, has returned to New Bedford to ask Bob for a divorce. She still loves Bob but does not want to take second place in his life to the mine. Things at the mine are in dire straits as the bank will soon foreclose on its loan and stop credit if the mine's new vein does not produce within two weeks. Bob pressures the mine workers into drilling and blasting quicker into the vein, this against the advice of the mine's explosives man, Gene MacFarlane, Alice's father. Gene officially voices his opposition to Bob's directive. Because of the aggressive blasting and poor materials, a serious accident does occur and Gene looks to be permanently blinded. Bob thinks it a good idea for the family to lay low because of the public outcry regarding the accident, but May refuses to hide which she feels would admit guilt. The entire Bailey clan does end up going to the dance, but their presence places a noticeable tension on the festivities, especially between the MacFarlane's and Bailey's. But Bob has ulterior motives in attending the dance, that reason he tells only to Grace before he executes his plan.",

    "description": "Joe Callaghan returns to New Bedford a seemingly changed man. Donning an expensive suit, Joe pays Honey back for all the money he took from her and then some. He has been earning this money working for Battling Bob, a promoter of professional wrestling. The show is coming to New Bedford which has the whole town abuzz. Honey has mixed feelings about seeing her brother as she isn't sure if he's changed. Never having met him before, Del is certain Joe is a shyster. Del does discover that the wrestling is a front for organized gambling and fight fixing. Del and Grace confront Joe, threatening to inform the police about it. Although Joe admits that he knows about the illegal activity, he tells them that he has no influence over Battling Bob. Del also recognizes the show's headliner world champion, the Dynamite Kid, as former renowned boxer, David Doyle. Doyle apparently faced a crisis of faith following his stint in the war. Hub and Fat idolize the Kid as they call him. Del appeals to the Kid's moral side to do the right thing with regard to the fight. Perhaps Joe will also do the right thing and not embarrass his sister, who will have to live in New Bedford following the aftermath.",

    "description": "Despite May's assurances that the mine is safe, the miners refuse to go back to work until they are guaranteed by the union that the mine is safe from any explosives. This labor unrest delays mine operations. May is in a Catch-22 situation: she needs an extension on the loan, but the bank won't provide an extension unless the mine is operating. Although Leo offers his moral persuasion assistance, May comes up with another idea when Ethan Newcombe, a friend of the Governor General's, gets stranded in New Bedford: May will convince Newcombe to persuade the Governor General to tour the mine. Newcombe is almost prepared to do so until a series of misunderstandings convinces him that May is unscrupulous and underhanded. Leo convinces May that a visit by the Governor General would not have made any difference in the situation, and it really is her herself that needs to show the miners an act of true belief in her own words to resolve the situation. On another work front, Daisy Whitney is appointed Principal of the school. She promptly buries the Vice-Principal, Max, under a pile of paperwork. And Honey finds out that she's pregnant. Hub is happy but doesn't really see what the big deal is. Fat, however, is not looking forward to yet another person entering the family.",

    "description": "After Mrs. Whitney and the school board insist that Max give up his radio job, Grace takes over as producer of the radio show. This directive from Mrs. Whitney is only one of many disagreements between herself and Max. Max suggests a series of extracurricular activities for the children, all turned down by Mrs. Whitney, except for one: career day, although she makes it more of an academic exercise than Max envisioned. Max secures fourteen businesses as sponsors, with each business hosting a pair of students. Career day ends up changing the career thoughts of the Bailey boys. Fat and Maisey are partnered. Fat desperately wants the police department as his career business, but they are stuck with the New Bedford Hotel. But based on rumors about Callie, Fat with partner Maisey decide to test out their policing skills. Hub and Buck, partnered, get the Silver Dome Mine much to Hub's dismay since he thinks he already knows all about that business. But he learns there is much more to the mine than what he's previously witnessed in the office. Although his career day experience excites him to the prospect of one day running the mine, Hub doesn't know if he has the aptitude. Meanwhile, Grace, on her new friend and radio station colleague Del's advice, contemplates leaving New Bedford for the bright lights of New York City.",

    "description": "Callie is taking greater control of the radio station. After she fires Skip Roper (a firing he quite gladly accepts as he has major disagreements with the tyrannical Callie), Callie decides to hire Grace as the new station manager, of course at a much reduced pay. On the surface, Grace is to have all the responsibility, but under the surface, Callie is still making all the important decisions. As Callie's sole goal is to make money, Grace is to find new advertisers for the station. One she does secure is Yuen's Laundry, Lee Yuen only agreeing if his brother, Chan, can do the radio spots for the laundry. Chan is a natural at it as he is articulate and well spoken with a great radio voice. Max notices Chan's abilities, and wants to use him as the main actor in the new murder mystery serial he is writing for radio. The problem is that there is no air time for the serial without cutting an existing program. Callie orders Grace to cancel \"Bible Hour with Reverend Milo McLellan\", the show she considers 'the least popular'. Grace doesn't agree as she thinks \"Bible Hour\" fills an important need for the community, but Grace can't refuse her boss' orders. This change in programming has mixed results. The radio serial, entitled \"The Adventures of Sam Chang: Private Investigator\", is a hit, and even draws Sunbrite Soap as a major new and quite lucrative sponsor for the radio station. However, there is major backlash against \"Bible Hour\"'s cancellation from its small in number but devoted listeners. And the radio station is vandalized with anti-Chinese graffiti sprayed across the front. Callie decides to lay all public blame for the radio station's problems on Grace. Callie fires Grace, reinstates \"Bible Hour\", and cancels \"The Adventures of Sam Chang\", the latter action based on the graffiti which she sees as a voice for the general public. One other issue with the vandalism is that Hub, with Maisey, was secretly in the radio station at the time the vandalism occurred. Interested in ham radios, Hub and Maisey broke into the station after hours to use the station's equipment. Hub witnessed the vandalism but initially doesn't want to tell either his parents or Sergeant Stoneman what he saw because he also broke the law by breaking into the station. Hub eventually does confess what happened as he would rather be punished for breaking and entering than have people think he's racist. Back with the management of the radio station, things start to unravel for Callie as she learns the vandalism was pure hooliganism by teenagers (i.e. not potential sponsors), and Sunbrite Soap has withdrawn their sponsorship since the serial is no longer airing. Callie decides to reinstate the serial and makes a public announcement to that fact. Getting the serial back on the air is not going to be as easy as Callie thinks. She has to do some major groveling and apologizing to several people for it to happen, especially to the no longer meek and timid Grace.",

    "description": "While Max and Honey go into Toronto for the weekend to visit a publisher about Max's writing, Del and Grace look after the kids. Hub, Fat and Maisey keep preoccupied for the weekend by searching the hotel for the ghost of Gap-Tooth Peggy. Alden and Callie have recently had a lot of plates break by falling off their plate rail. Although Callie thinks it's the vibration caused by the kids cavorting around the hotel, Alden tells Fat that it is the ghost of Gap-Tooth Peggy breaking the plates. Even the hotel chambermaids believe the story of Gap-Tooth Peggy, a former resident of the hotel who killed herself there. The kids decide to find conclusive evidence that the ghost of Gap-Tooth Peggy really does exist. With the kids' weekend guardians, there seems to be something new and unspoken between Del and Grace. They have been spending a lot of time together lately with their connection with the kids and their work at the radio station. Grace knows that she has feelings for Del, but Del just won't quite admit to himself that he has such feelings for Grace, especially since he doesn't think he's Grace's type. Regardless of these thoughts, Grace and Ollie are still dating each other, and Del has just started seeing Marjorie. Marjorie wants to look nice for her upcoming date, and although Grace states that she isn't a licensed hairdresser and doesn't consciously try to sabotage Del's new relationship, Grace, in Honey's absence, does agree to give Marjorie a hair set and facial, both which end in disaster. Del and Marjorie's date also ends in disaster when Del won't stop talking about Grace. Simultaneously, Grace and Ollie's date ends worse when Ollie confesses that he loves her, something that Grace admits to him that she knows she will never feel for him.",

    "description": "May's cousin, Jessie Buchanan, is coming to New Bedford for a visit. Cousin Jessie has always been somewhat of a motherly figure for May, albeit an unwanted one for the independent May. Cousin Jessie decided to visit solely to get May's life back on track. Since Bob left, May has been dedicating all her time to the mine and her angina has gotten worse. Jessie feels that May needs to focus more on family in the here and now - which not only includes Grace, Hub, Fat and Violet, but also Honey, Max and even Del, Leo and Maisey - rather than what May has been doing which is to focus on the mine solely as a legacy for Hub and Fat. Grace and Cousin Jessie end up being partners in crime in the task of getting May to change her ways, much to May's consternation. Their scheming includes trying to reunite May with Leo in a romantic fashion. With finances for the mine, May needs to raise some quick capital, and makes the decision to sell some property. One of the properties of which she is thinking is some on the lake front which she has been holding onto for sentimental reasons. After conferring with Leo, they decide it is worthless from a mining perspective but worthwhile for development. As May is not in the development business, she decides it is the one to sell. The people who seem to be perfect purchasers are Callie's slightly business-unscrupulous relatives, father and son Hugo and Luc Gerrard. Just as May is about to sell the property to the Gerrard's, Grace and Cousin Jessie unwittingly thwart the deal, which ends up being a good thing as Max discovers the property is rich in nickel. A selfless act by Max shows May that Cousin Jessie may actually be right about her life and relationships.",

    "description": "Business troubles are brewing in New Bedford. At the pawn shop, Maisey sells a watch in which the pawn ticket has not expired, the rightful owner who comes back to retrieve his property. He threatens to sue unless he gets his watch back. On a larger scale, the Silver Dome Mine is still experiencing troubles. Despite the nickel deposit found on May's property, the bank is still thinking about calling its bank loan unless the mine itself starts showing some major revenues in the immediate future. Coinciding with this move, May decides it's time that Hub learns more about the mine. She gives him the 200 shares of the mine that were originally Jack's. But the pressures of life are getting to her and May suffers a minor heart attack. If the bank finds out about her medical problems, they will definitely call the loan. Grace calls Bob back from Toronto so that the shareholders can discuss the mine's future. In addition to wanting him to learn about the overall workings of the mine, May wants Hub to act as her spy to see what the others are planning on doing \"behind her back\". Luc Gerrard is slyly looking to take control of the mine. Bob wants to sell the mine and finds a willing buyer in Luc for half of his 200 shares. Grace, a 200 share holder, wants what she considers best for the family. Del convinces her that the best option is for her temporarily to take control of running the mine until May recovers as the other two obvious options are not really feasible: the bank would not look kindly on Bob regaining his leading position, and an outsider in Luc would not be in the Bailey's best interest. However May, holding 400 shares, sees both Bob and Grace's moves as trying to usurp her authority, a knife in her back in figurative terms. That means that Hub, whose votes go to Honey as underage Hub's guardian, may be the deciding force. Hub needs to decide between heeding the wishes of his grandmother, deciding what's best for the economic health of the family and the mine, and what's best for May's personal health. Through this difficult time for Grace which includes harsh and unkind words from May, Del and Grace become closer, both who know they are attracted to each other but also know that they are not right for each other.",

    "description": "Troubles are still brewing at the mine. Grace is the new figurehead for the company, but May is still making the decisions. This strain between the two made Grace move out of the house. The bank is expecting its latest payment on time or will call the note. Luc offers a loan to the mine which May reluctantly accepts. But Hugo has other ideas which may jeopardize the Bailey's ownership of the company. Luc also suggests holding a dance for the mine workers to thank them for their support. This dance offers Grace the opportunity to evaluate her personal life. She and Del are still flirting with each other, but others have placed into her head that Luc may be a suitable beau. Callie also places this idea in Luc's head - if only for the power of their collective shares in the mine - but Luc also admits to Callie that he has personal feelings for Grace. Del finally admits to Grace his feelings for her, but is it too late? At the Bailey household, May is alone now that Grace has moved out, except for the presence of her private nurse, Nurse Harper who was appointed by Dr. Barlow. Nurse Harper and May do not get along so it is with mixed blessings for May that Cousin Jessie has returned to New Bedford to take care of her. And Honey is close to her delivery date. The entire family want to be part of naming the baby, Fat who thinks he's come up with the best boy's name. This name will not only need Honey and Max's approval, but May's as well. Honey unfortunately goes into labor when she and May are alone stranded at the mine office.",

    "description": "The Baileys are in dire straits. They learn Hugo has no intention of keeping the mine open if and when he buys it - in his own words, buy what others want. May plans on selling some of her land holdings not to reopen the mine if it goes into receivership but solely for her and Grace to live (Grace can no longer provide any income to the household as Callie, not wanting to deal with a Bailey, fires her from the radio station), however the property at Bass Lake is one with which May will not part. It is that property however that Luc and Hugo want to purchase to develop into a resort. Luc is still interested in striking both a professional and personal relationship with Grace, the former required if he is indeed able to purchase the Bass Lake property from May. With Del still confessing feelings but not a long term commitment, Grace entertains the idea of a relationship with Luc. Ultimately, Grace admits her true personal feelings. On the professional front, May may be able to keep the mine open as one of her other investments - in an oil exploration venture - shows promise. However, Mr. Sainsbury at the bank is unwilling to offer May any credit only on the prospect of oil coming through, this despite Mr. Kendrick's willingness since he is a New Bedford resident who wants to see the mine succeed. From a conversation Grace overhears, she learns that Hugo has other ideas for the Bass Lake property when he gets his hands on it, Hugo who is in collusion with someone who can assist in getting the property from May. May, who has ideas of her own to salvage her family business, holds a family meeting to help her make the ultimate decision. It is a idea from Hub that helps May execute her final plan.",

    "description": "Three couples evaluate their relationships. Grace and Del have been dating but Grace feels that they are still incompatible as a couple. She thinks she has scientific evidence to this fact when she takes a magazine romance quiz and fails. However she doesn't bother to tell Del why she's been so standoffish of late. Honey and Max look at their life following Zach's birth. Honey receives some devastating news: due to the complications from the birth, she can probably no longer have any more children. She feels that she has lost one manifestation of her love for Max and a part of her own womanhood. With this news, Max revisits his own insecurities about Honey, in choosing him, settling for second best after Jack's death. To help them through this difficult time, May thinks they need a romantic getaway and offers them the use of the cabin at Bass Lake for the weekend while she takes care of her grandchildren. The weekend at the lake ends up not really helping Max and Honey as unbeknownst to anyone, Bob and Toppy have made the trek from Toronto to the Bass Lake cabin for the weekend as well. Upon seeing the Torontonians, Max and Honey can see that there is something different and troubling in Bob and Toppy's marriage. Bob and Toppy are keeping one collective secret which is placing strain on their marriage, but Bob has one of his own that could cause even more damage. Back in New Bedford, Wanless Furniture is sponsoring a bed race. Hub, Fat and Maisey are sure they can win. All they need is a bed, a sponsor (which they find in Ollie) and a little luck. They aren't going to win if the Cramps have any say in the matter, the Cramps who are entering the race themselves and who place a wager with the children on the race outcome.",

    "description": "Following her separation from Bob, Toppy is back in New Bedford living in May's house. She is feeling self-conscious of her new separated status and the probable talk around town behind her back. Meanwhile, fourteen year old Hub is growing up and getting to the stage in life where he is testing his own mettle. Honey and Max are asking more of him around the house. And the adults around town see him as a good boy. However, what he sees as his goody-goody status does not sit well with him as he feels it is too constricting on his life. He rebels by hanging out with the boys at the pool hall, something a good boy would not do. Although not directly associated with them, Hub does protect the wrong-doings of those boys, and even contributes to the wrong-doings by stealing pocket change from his mother's business to play pinball. Max knows what's going on with Hub. Rather than harshly discipline him, Max decides a better course of action is to acknowledge the wrong-doings and ask Hub to make amends for it. But Hub needs to figure out for himself how he best fits into life in New Bedford at this transitional stage of life. This thought process is assisted when he is asked to sit vigil overnight for the body of Ruth Fillian - a teen-aged girl who committed suicide - and after he takes the literal leap of faith that all the other boys who verge into manhood have taken in New Bedford by jumping off the railroad trestle into the lake below just before the arrival of the train.",

    "description": "Max and Honey have decided to give Hub a little more leeway in his life, something difficult for Honey to do as she still does not agree with many of the choices he is making. Doris is coming back to New Bedford to visit with her mother. Along with Doris are her two snobbish friends, sisters Frankie and Clarice Bloore, to whom Doris has told fanciful stories of her mother's glamorous but tragic life, the stories seemingly straight out of a romance novel. Upon their arrival, the Bloore sisters see in New Bedford and its residents a backward rural town and backward townsfolk not to their urban sensibilities. Toppy gets wind of her daughter's stories about her and does whatever she can to gain her daughter's approval. Doris' visit coincides with the annual New Bedford Fall Fair. Historically organized by May, the Fall Fair this year is being organized by Grace because of May's health issues. Things are going relatively smoothly until the grand prize for the fair's showpiece - the most beautiful mother-baby competition - gets broken in transit to New Bedford. Along comes Tucker Findlay to save the day. Tucker is a photographer with popular Vanity Lane magazine, he who is traveling the Ontario fair circuit doing portraiture sales. He offers his services as the grand prize. Although a good photographer, Tucker is a scam artist, bilking local businesses along the way and offering unrealistic hopes of fame and fortune to his customers for a price. What's worse is that he is a Lothario preying on unsuspecting women. Although caught up like everyone else with Tucker's promises, Honey soon learns first hand of Tucker's true nature. First, he captures a risqué photograph of Honey - unintentionally risqué on Honey's part - which he talks Alden into running as the front page photograph for the Chronicle's Fall Fair edition. And second, he gropes Honey at a later photo shoot. When Tucker seemingly has run out of town without settling his financial accounts, Honey, Max, Archie, Grace and Hub go after him at what is his last scheduled meeting in New Bedford, that at the Bailey household to take Toppy's portrait. Will they make it in time to catch Tucker and more importantly save Toppy from his groping hands?",

    "description": "Many in town are getting into new business ventures. With the demise of the North Bridge bus, Alden and Callie want to start their own bus line both to keep the viability and need for the hotel by bringing people to town, and to make money. They talk Del into being a 25% partner, Del who is solely to provide mechanical support and the driving. Del regrets getting into this venture when he first sees the bus Alden purchases and second when the Cramps take total control of the decision making. Max gets into a business venture of his own with the Cramps when he needs transportation for the boy's basketball team to Pinebury and talks Alden into a creative win-win solution with his new bus. Max also later regrets this venture when Alden's decision making gets them into trouble. On smaller scales, Alice is working with her mother cleaning houses. And Fat and Maisey, who stumble along an overturned transport truck with cargo, decide to take the caseload of dry breakfast cereal. Their thought is to send the boxtops to the cereal company for their advertised giveaways, and sell the cereal itself at a marked down price to whomever wants to buy it. Fat also later regrets this decision as no one wants the cereal and when Max gets wind of what Fat did, Fat is grounded. Hub has other things on his mind. At age fourteen, he is going through puberty - the fever as Maisey calls it - and is starting to notice girls. The one he has his eye on is fourteen year-old Alice, who is also going through the change physically. Hub thinks he may be in love. But Alice, who is still not allowed to talk to \"a Bailey\", also has other things on her mind. She hates her life: her father has begun to drink due to not being able to work because of his disability, and she has to work to help make ends meet for the family. In addition to Hub, she also catches the eye of Cliff, a young twenty-something man in town to help clear the transport truck mess. In Cliff, Alice sees someone who can get her out of her miserable life in New Bedford. Hub does whatever he can to stop Alice from getting involved with Cliff, although Hub isn't sure if he's doing it for Alice's sake or his own.",

    "description": "Penniless recluse Orvy Potter has just passed away. In his will, he has bequeathed a Mexican crystal skull to May. Orvy states in a note to May that the skull has psychic powers, but also contains a curse that will be unleashed to anyone who disposes of it unwisely. Despite not having any emotional ties, Orvy's bequest to May was because he figured she of everyone he knew would know what to do with it. May thinks that claims of the skull's powers are nonsense, but Grace, Toppy, Fat and Maisey are intrigued. Grace and Toppy decide to test Orvy's claim regarding the skull; one by one, the questions they ask of the skull are answered in some fashion. News of the skull's powers quickly spreads among town, especially to May's friends and even Sergeant Stoneman, who wants to consult the skull on some unsolved petty theft cases. May is still skeptical until she inadvertently gets an important answer to a personal question in the presence of the skull. In another situation, she has a dream in the skull's presence which if true would help her on the road to saving the family business. With help from a stranger, May tests her dream. After May finds out the skull's history, cultural value and economic value, she decides to give it back to who she feels is the rightful owner. Meanwhile, a collection of squatters is found on May's Bass Lake property, apparently the group part of a relocation program of homeless out of Toronto who once out of the Toronto city limits are meant to fend for themselves. Among the squatters is young teen Ruby Trammel, who Maisey knew and hated in Toronto and who is every bit as tough as Maisey. Although Maisey has told fanciful stories of her own father being a mariner sailing around the world, his whereabouts and condition unknown, Ruby is spreading rumors of Maisey not ever knowing her father, a convicted criminal. Although not knowing the entire truth, Fat knows that Ruby's tales are probably closer to reality. But Fat sticks with Maisey, his friend, in her time of emotional need. Fat and Maisey decide to consult the skull about Maisey's father. This question looks to be one that will go unanswered until a mysterious young man arrives in New Bedford asking about Maisey.",

    "description": "Crime is on the minds of New Bedford residents. Baby Face Nelson has been pulling his bank robberies in the States, and locally a band of robbers known as the Burlesque Bandits have been holding up unsuspecting victims. The Bandits have not yet arrived in New Bedford but the Cramps have been stirring up fear through what May considers sensationalistic journalism by glamorizing these acts of crime both in the Chronicle and on CRNB radio. At the same time, the mysterious stranger just arrived in town has caught at least Maisey's attention. The stranger, Eddy Jackson, has been hanging around her and the pawn shop. She thinks that he's casing the place to later rob it. But Eddy has been hired by the Cramps as the new bartender at the hotel, so he is at least trying to earn a decent wage. Leo recognizes Eddy as a shifty character from Cabbagetown, the old neighborhood where they lived in Toronto. Eddy had spent some time in jail for his past illegal deeds. Leo has not told anyone he knows Eddy. When Leo finally talks to Eddy for the first time, Leo learns that he is Maisey's biological father - Maisey being the reason Eddy has come to town - Maisey's parentage of which Eddy thought Leo knew. Leo wants Eddy to have nothing to do with Maisey. When the Cramps are held up by the Burlesque Bandits, many in town jump to the conclusion that Eddy is responsible, despite the fact that Eddy's watch was also stolen in the hold-up. Sergeant Stoneman brings Eddy in for questioning and detains Eddy when he learns that Eddy has a criminal record. The real Bandits try to hawk the stolen jewelry at the pawn shop, the loot which includes Eddy's watch which Fat recognizes. Ultimately the real Bandits are caught and Eddy's watch returned. But Eddy's reputation has now been tarnished in New Bedford and thus he can no longer stay there. Based on the inscription on the back of the watch, Maisey suspects he may be her father, a question she asks him directly. Eddy denies Maisey's question and he leaves town, but not before leaving her with a keepsake.",

    "description": "With silver prices down and nickel prices up, May thinks it's a good time to move mining operations out to the Bass Lake property. To do so, the company will need to have their line of credit reinstated, which should only be a formality. For added insurance, May asks her old friend, Senator Carlisle Woodman who is now a board member with the Royal Dominion Bank, to use whatever influence he has to ensure the line of credit is approved. The senator is in town to help his son Maurice campaign, Maurice the Tory candidate running in the local federal by-election. Despite the senator's influence, Mr. Sainsbury still has the final say as District Manager, he who politely tells the senator to stay out of the business affairs of the bank. Against the wishes of Benjamin Kendrick, the local bank manager, Sainsbury declines the credit. Catching the senator in a white lie, May reevaluates her political friendships and her politics in total, especially when she speaks to the enthusiastic but self-deprecating Angus Hardy, the candidate for the newly formed Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). With the bank, May still has a few tricks up her sleeve, which are made all the more easy to implement effectively when Hub and Fat uncover Sainsbury's true motivations and his actions to implement his own plans. Meanwhile, the Sutton brothers teach the local children the skill of orienteering when a small child is lost. And Del has to make some tough decisions when Ollie lays him off due to lack of business at the garage. Grace wants to be part of the decision making. Although she may not be able ultimately to influence Del, Grace can at least make decisions which affect her own happiness.",

    "description": "The birth of the Dionne Quintuplets is all the talk in New Bedford. Grace in particular is fascinated by the story, she who is keeping a scrapbook on the babies. May is concerned that the Dionne Quintuplets and the scrapbook are replacements for Del, who has left town and Grace. Other town news is the permanent nervous leave taken by teacher, Mr. Bedoes. The reason for his leave brings to the forefront the on-going disagreement between Mrs. Whitney and Max on administering the strap on students, Mrs. Whitney being pro-strap, Max against the strap. In Mr. Bedoes' place is Mr. Flett - Jim - a widower who has been looking for a permanent teaching position. Jim is cerebral and quiet but he inspires his students - his life motto is \"FLETT\": first learn everything, then think. May thinks that Jim would be the perfect suitor for Grace, who is embarrassed by her mother's forthrightness in approaching Jim, especially since Del has only been gone for a short time. Jim may not be ready to date either as he has only been widowed for a short period (just over a year). With Jim is his son Pritchard, his given name being his mother's maiden name. Pritchard, who is Fat's age, is precocious, equally intellectual as his father, and one who has the gift of the gab. He is also small for his age but nonetheless plucky. Fat doesn't much like Pritchard, and some on-going issues between the two at school again raises the issue of effective discipline on students, Mrs. Whitney who increasingly pressures Max into using the strap as discipline. In Mrs. Whitney's view, Max's only other option if he is not going to use the strap as discipline is to resign as Vice-Principal. Max is forced to administer the strap on a student he later finds out did not commit the offense for which he was punished. This situation ultimately brings Fat and Pritchard closer as friends. But the issue of the strap's use eventually goes to the school board who has the final decision on the matter, regardless of Max or Mrs. Whitney's views.",

She starts a business as advertised at the back of Tinsel Times magazine, not so much for the income but because she thought it would bring her one step closer to being like a star. The venture is an utter failure. Just then, Nathan Sparks arrives in town. A director with Associated Screen Productions - a production company that specializes in newsreels - he is only passing through on his way to do a newsreel on the Dionne Quintuplets. Sparks' dream as a filmmaker is to make important feature length movies that have social significance, if only his producer/financier Bert Potter thought the same. Grace thinks Sparks' presence in New Bedford is fate. She convinces him to turn one of his stories into a feature length film to be scripted by Max and filmed in New Bedford with real people as the actors. The filming has its problems, especially in overacting by the non-actors, and Sparks only having a limited amount of film with which to work. But Ollie sees this project as an opportunity to rekindle his relationship with Grace. The entire project is halted when Bert Potter comes to town looking for his employee. Despite this dream not working out, Sparks' visit is ultimately beneficial for both him and Grace in knowing what they need to do in achieving their respective dreams. Grace's self-esteem is heightened with a little help from Fat, who is trying to find his own place in life in New Bedford.",

    "description": "It's the Christmas season, 1934, and a time for reflection for many New Bedford residents. On pragmatic matters, May is quickly called away to Cape Breton to take care of Cousin Jessie, who has taken a fall and requires care. Doris is spending the holidays in New York with her friends, which gets both Grace and Toppy thinking about their own lives and dreams. Grace laments never having accomplished anything she's ever wanted to do, such as travel, and laments the suitors that have gone from her life. And Toppy laments her new separated status - at least with Grace, she sees someone who had a choice in her life whereas her separation from Bob was his decision. But Alden and Callie, in addition to wanting to make money, are building on these and other dreams by sponsoring a 126-hour dance marathon to start on Boxing Day, ending on the stroke of midnight New Years Day, 1935. The winners, if any, will win $200. To build loyalty into the CRNB listening audience, the Cramps also sponsor a team for which they think their listeners will cheer. They recruit Max and Honey, the Cramps who offer them as a winner's bonus three months free rent. Max and Honey agree to this deal, and think about buying a house with the possible winnings. But the Suttons aren't the only ones who hope to win to fulfill their dreams. Hub enters with Alice, Hub who thinks he's in love with her, but Alice who only sees in Hub a friend, like a brother. Toppy convinces Archie to dance with her, despite admitting he does not know how to dance. And Grace goes to reliable Ollie to ask him to be her partner, but Ollie is not there for her this time as he is now serious about Marjorie who will be his dance partner. Grace decides to ask Jim, who she doesn't know well, but being alone during the holiday season - Pritchard is in Niagara Falls visiting with his maternal grandparents - he agrees. Jim is still mourning the death of his wife, Kathleen, and is only doing this to get into New Bedford life. During the process of the marathon, the respective dance partners get to know each other better and get to know their deepest dreams and feelings. Will any of them get to fulfill their dreams by winning the contest?",

This incident is only the latest which gets Honey into a old feud with May regarding what Honey sees as May's criticisms of her both as a mother and a human being. Honey has of late been assisting Iris Barlow in the women's mission, specifically in halting the spread of influenza that has not quite yet reached New Bedford, and providing services for and supplies to those on relief. What she feels is her small contribution, Honey provides free hairdressing service to those on relief. One of her free clients is Norma, who Honey sees much like herself immediately after Jack's death. Norma, with two children both still in the diaper stage, has been traveling around Northern Ontario looking for her husband who has been searching for work. Honey does whatever she can to help Norma get through this rough time. Norma and her two children become ill, and Honey appoints herself as their nursemaid. The illness turns out to be the virulent strain of influenza that has already killed six people in Pinebury. Honey ends up being quarantined at Norma's apartment because of it. Norma and her family recover from the illness, however Honey comes down with a worse case of the illness since Honey had had a previous chest infection which made her more susceptible to such. With the hospital in North Bridge already overflowing to the rafters, Dr. Barlow feels he can better treat Honey at home. May shows the family what she really thinks of Honey when it looks like Honey may not survive her illness.",

    "description": "The mood in the Sutton household is somber as Honey is still in the hospital in Toronto, with little news making it back to New Bedford about her condition. But the family is trying to continue with life. Max in particular is exhausted and is asking more from the boys to keep the household functioning. Fat, with Maisey and Pritchard, have a new fascination with Buck Rogers. Jim fuels this fascination with theories of life on Mars. Hub is still thinking about Alice, now that she is again speaking to him. But Mrs. MacFarlane knows that nothing can ever come of a union between a Bailey and a MacFarlane, a concern she expresses directly to May. But Alice has other thoughts on her mind, which is ultimately indirectly aided by a move by her mother. On business fronts, May is holding a shareholders meeting to discuss publicly trading the company with the new nickel venture at Bass Lake. Bob is coming from Montreal for the meeting. Both May and Toppy see Bob's impending visit as both a positive professional and personal visit to get involved in the family business once again, and move back to New Bedford to resume his life with Toppy. However, Bob's intentions are exactly the opposite as he brings his new girlfriend to New Bedford with him. The shareholder meeting also brings to the forefront the issue that Max, having never adopted the boys, is not their legal guardian. This news prompts a reaction from Fat. Meanwhile, Ollie and Marjorie are preparing for their impending nuptials. As Marjorie seemingly has few close friends, Grace throws Marjorie a bridal shower, which results in townsfolk talking about Grace trying to display outwardly that she has no romantic feelings for Ollie. When Libby, Marjorie's sister and matron of honor, sprains her ankle, Grace is also forced to act as Marjorie's new maid of honor. Grace isn't sure if she should accept this role, especially after an admission from Ollie.",

Newly independent Toppy, who has just bought a house, is attracting the attention of Archie. Although she supports her soon to be ex-daughter-in-law, May can only publicly support Toppy so much because of her blood ties to Bob. And Grace is also showing some independence in spending a week alone at the cabin at Bass Lake. Jim and Pritchard coincidentally are also spending the week at the lake, about which Grace is quietly excited. Even though she knows she and Jim have nothing in common, she is attracted to him, but she receives more attention from her crush, the junior Flett, Pritchard. The threesome's time at the lake faces some challenges because of the difference between Jim and Grace, but also because of two escaped convicts, including Mr. Sainsbury, who has a personal vendetta against the Baileys. Jim and Grace come to a new quiet understanding and respect for each other after their time at the lake.",

    "description": "Now that Toppy has moved out of the Bailey house, she has to find something to do with her life. On Archie and Grace's urging - especially since Grace needs acts for her radio talent show which Callie threatens to cancel - Toppy decides to open a school for the performing arts. The first hurdle is that Toppy needs Bob to co-sign the bank loan, which she refuses to even ask Bob to do. Grace thus decides to become Toppy's business partner, financing half the school. May doesn't think it a good idea since she sees neither Grace or Toppy being business minded. However an argument over the matter results in May throwing Grace out of the house, Grace who ends up rooming with Toppy. The school gets no business until Althea Bridgeman, an old friend of Toppy's who has just returned to New Bedford from Toronto, gets her daughter Laura to teach a ballet class at the school and uses her networking among the town's woman's club to have all the daughters enrolled. Laura catches the eye of Hub, the two of who bond over swing music and swing dancing, which is taking New Bedford by storm. Overprotective and prudish Althea doesn't approve of swing or - after an incident between Hub and Laura - Toppy, who, as a divorcée, she sees as an inappropriate role model for her daughter. Althea uses her influence in the town to get all the students to pull out of the school. Not only concerned for her business but her standing in the community, Toppy, with moral support from May, sympathetically confronts the women of New Bedford. Although Toppy is able to open their eyes, she closes the New Bedford Academy, but it's not the end of business life for the now independent Toppy.",

But Ollie confesses to Marjorie that what looks like doting on Grace is just doing some activities that are enjoyable to him regardless of the person. Alice returns to New Bedford to live with her impoverished mother, Lorna, and drunkard father, Eugene. Alice has been telling everyone that she left her cousin's farm on her own accord, but she confides to Hub that she was kicked out because she's pregnant. Hub will do whatever he can to help her out, even offering to marry her. But Alice, under the guise of needing money to take the train to live with an aunt in Buffalo, decides the best thing to do is to get an illegal abortion. Not knowing what to do, Hub finally confides to Grace, who in turn confronts Alice for using Hub. Alice in turn accuses Grace of not ever taking any responsibility in her own life, which Grace admits to herself is the truth. This accusation helps in both mending her relationship with Ollie and Marjorie as a couple, and in helping Alice's situation in a meaningful way. Grace realizes the best thing she can offer Alice is moral support as Alice tells her mother the truth. Meanwhile, Fat, who feels he is destined to be short for the rest of his life, turns to gypsy Roolie for help to solve his problem.",

    "description": "Novelist Hugh Frampton comes to New Bedford to do research for his new book. He is a drinker, a womanizer and gruff. Everyone in New Bedford however is in awe of his celebrity, especially Max, the aspiring writer. The only person not in awe is Toppy, who stands up to Frampton after he paws over Grace, who was hoping to do an interview with him for her radio show. After sobering up, Frampton realizes that it is Toppy who is the love of his life. After seeing a more compassionate Frampton, Toppy too begins to have feelings for Frampton. The two start courting in front of a jealous Archie. Meanwhile, tales of an undiscovered lode of silver in the old abandoned mine owned by May brings out the curiosity and adventure in Fat and Pritchard. Despite warnings from Maisey and Hub, Fat and Pritchard go into the mine and get trapped. Max in particular feels guilty about the boys' precarious situation since he has been ignoring the kids to pursue his writing. The town comes together to mount a rescue effort. At the mine, Grace, testing her journalistic mettle, does an on-site radio report, which includes a pointed interview with May, the owner of the mine, about her responsibility in the boys' situation. Beyond all the tensions built up at the mine, Grace ultimately comes up with the solution to at least locate the boys in the mine shaft. The plan works and the boys are saved. Frampton's research is complete, and it's time for him to leave New Bedford, and he wants Toppy to go with him. But living life as the companion of a constantly on-the-go author is not one for Toppy, who stays in New Bedford.",

    "description": "Leo McGinty passes away, leaving Maisey all alone in the world. May is the executor of Leo's will and he appoints May to be Maisey's guardian and leaves all possessions, including the pawn shop and the building, to Maisey. As such, Maisey is to move in with May and May suggests closing the pawn shop until Maisey becomes of age. Maisey has other ideas - she wants to run the pawn shop and continue to live there on her own. Maisey and May continue their battle of wills as Maisey does move in with May. However, Maisey is certain that drifter ex-con Eddy Jackson is her biological father. She runs a classified ad in the Toronto newspaper hoping that Eddy will read it and come for her. He indeed is her father and does come to New Bedford, with his wife Lucille in tow, to collect Maisey. Eddy seems to have got his life in order, however May won't absolve her responsibility toward Maisey that easily and allow Eddy and Lucille to take all that was left to Maisey. After Fat and Pritchard catch Lucille rifling through May's personal possessions, they suspect that she is just a gold-digger, so they end up hatching a plan to expose her. The plan works as she is caught red handed stealing what she thinks are Leo's gold nuggets. That's when the truth comes out: Eddy did come for Maisey, but only brought along his fake wife Lucille to look more respectable. Instead of pressing charges, May decides the best thing is to kick Eddy and Lucille out of New Bedford for good. But when Maisey wants her father present when they scatter Leo's ashes, May sees the concern Eddy does have for his daughter. May decides the best thing for Maisey is for her and her father to stay in New Bedford, Eddy who will run the pawn shop until Maisey becomes of age.",

Before Grace can get her interview, Lillian runs off. Lillian had just had a major breakdown in faith when she saw her manager, Hiram Beecher, pay someone who she thought she had just healed. Lillian manages to make her way to New Bedford, where, obviously distraught, she runs into Fat, who out of compassion offers to put her up. But she doesn't tell him who she is, and as such, Fat believes she has amnesia. As she can't stay at the hotel due to the Cramp's strict policy, Max decides that Toppy and Grace's house would be the most appropriate place for the mysterious stranger. When Lillian arrives at the house, Grace and Toppy don't recognize her since she is out of costume. However, once a major news release is issued regarding a reward for the return of Lillian Day, Grace knows who her new house-guest is. Lillian confesses and tells the group her story. They know they have to protect Lillian from Hiram until Lillian decides what she needs to do. However, Callie also puts two and two together and drawn to the reward money, turns Lillian over to Hiram. Hiram threatens Lillian: if she dissolves their business arrangement, he will expose her as a fraud with a plethora of paid \"healed\" people to support his story. But Grace has a plan to let Lillian tell her story to the world, let Hiram take the fall, and still allow Lillian to devote her life in a meaningful way to her faith. Meanwhile, Grace and May have an argument over who is best to handle Grace's financial affairs.",

    "description": "Remembrance Day 1935 is approaching and the Nazi uprising in Europe is taking place. For the Remembrance Day service in New Bedford, a new cenotaph will be unveiled. As usual, Alden, the supposed war hero, adamantly refuses to partake in any of the formal rituals of the day, Callie not even knowing why. Despite he not having died in the war, Old Roolie wants the name of her son, Karl, placed on the cenotaph; she accuses everyone in the town, but especially May, as being the cause of his death. Roolie later tells the kids that Karl was a conscientious objector, who because of his beliefs, was ostracized from the town and beaten to death. They learn from Alden that Karl is actually still alive and living in a nearby town. Grace is livid that Karl has not taken responsibility for his mother, who is now at a stage in her life where she needs someone to look after her. After initially denying that he is Roolie's son, Karl comes to see his mother for the first time in twenty years. He also confronts his then enemy, Alden, who was one of the instigators of his ostracizing and beating. Although they have come to an understanding of each other's position, they recognize that the war had a profound negative effect on each of their personal lives in different ways. It isn't until Daisy Whitney, the town's war mother - she lost all three of her sons in the war - speaks to Alden, that he admits the nature of his Remembrance Day sorrows: he may have saved three of the thirty men in his company in a battle, but the other twenty-seven perished, a fact he does not want to remember or celebrate.",

    "description": "Del returns to New Bedford. His stay is uncertain as he left his assembly line job in Windsor, which he hated, with possible thoughts of going west to Vancouver. The two people in New Bedford closest to him, Max and Grace, have mixed feelings about his return. Max wishes that he could get settled and be stable in his life, but after an initial brush-off, decides to let his brother stay with him. Grace, not having heard from Del since he left over a year ago, says that she has moved on with her life, but she obviously still has feelings for him as he does for her. She admits to Toppy that those feeling are primarily of a sexual nature, to which Toppy responds that that can only get one so far in a relationship. One other relationship Del strengthens is with Fat, who he sees a lot like himself at that age: the underdog. Del mentors Fat in boxing, with Del's emphasis on \"fighting\", while Max dotes on the star boxer, Hub. Based on Del's coaching, Fat's style is more street boxing which gets him disqualified in the regional boxing finals. Angry at what he sees as his unfair treatment and the special treatment given to Hub, Fat needs to take his anger out on his brother. With Del and Grace, Del sees that Grace and Jim have a mutual attraction and shows his jealousy. Del ultimately tells Grace that he loves her, but she knows, and convinces him, that it is not love but going back to what feels comfortable in his life, especially at this time of uncertainty. The \"sirens\" she felt for him are no longer there, and Del decides to leave New Bedford. Meanwhile, Hub is facing his own relationship triangle. He likes Laura, but feels guilty about abandoning Alice - his friend and one of the few real friendships she has - in her time of need.",

    "description": "It was a dark and stormy night as the first storm of the season passes through New Bedford. The storm has knocked out the power in town and the telephone lines at the hotel are malfunctioning. Along with this, the latest police serial magazine has hit the newsstands. Strapped for money, Max thinks he can write a story for the magazine, which is offering $100 for accepted stories. But he only has until the end of the weekend in which to complete a story from scratch to meet the magazine's deadline. To make things easier, he decides to set the story on a stormy night in a small town hotel much like the New Bedford Hotel, with a cast of characters that loosely resemble townsfolk. The only difference between reality and fiction is that in the story there is a killer loose in their midst, the murder victim being someone resembling Callie Cramp. Potboilers not being his usual writing genre, Max accepts suggestions from anyone he can, and everyone has a suggestion to offer, all in the vein of enlarging the role of the character that most closely resembles oneself. Meanwhile, Fat and Pritchard are looking after Callie, who is bedridden with a cold and who is without Alden, stranded out of town by the storm. The three think they overhear a murder plot, the intended victim they believe is Callie herself. Is fiction mirroring reality? They do whatever they can to determine who the murderer is. After one mishap after another, they finally find out who they think is the murderer. However the entire story ends being not quite what they originally thought. By the end of the weekend, the storm has subsided, the power has returned and Max has finished his story. 'Wait until you read it in the next edition' is his answer when everyone queries him on who he made the killer.",

    "description": "Grace is chairing her 20th class reunion committee, with Marjorie being her chief volunteer \"slave\". The reunion is a time for her class to reflect on their lives. Marjorie is happy with her life with Ollie, but is concerned about continually not being able to make ends meet. She also wants to start a family, which Ollie does not want to do until they are financially solvent. Ollie, on the other hand, is unhappy with the path he chose for his professional life, stating that if he had to do it all over again he would choose to be a pilot. This unhappiness spills over into his personal life which in turn concerns and affects Marjorie. As Grace complains that no one in New Bedford from their class has made anything important of their lives that would be inspirational enough to be the keynote address for the reunion, Fred Wales, an old classmate and renowned pilot, makes an emergency landing in New Bedford with his business partner, Warner Shank. Fred's arrival stirs up the 'what I should have done with my life' amongst his old classmates, especially Ollie, who is quietly envious of Fred. His arrival also stirs up ideas amongst the younger generation of what they can do with their lives, especially Fat and Maisey who both want to be pilots when they grow up. Fred is the obvious choice for the reunion's keynote address. Warner is an opportunistic businessman who will seize any opportunity to make a dollar, and on this trip he is using Fred as his glitzy front man - this glitz which hides a poor business plan - to start a new airline serving Northern Ontario. The glitz does not work on May, who Warner wants as a major investor; May sees that Warner is on to a good idea, but that he is not the one to execute it and she decides not to invest. So Warner moves onto the next person from who he can make some money, namely Ollie. He encourages Ollie to build a plane that he has designed, promising him wealth and fame if he does. Ollie, excited that he may be able to break out of his rut, works on his plane with fervor with help from Fat and Maisey, but on its showing to the press, the plane malfunctions badly. Ollie is humiliated, that is until Warner encourages him some more, telling him to make a few modifications to the design which they can ultimately patent. Fred, whose worldly and famous façade masks some deep seated loneliness and unhappiness of its own, wakes Ollie up to the fact that Warner is just using him. Marjorie, seeing how destructive this series of events has had on her husband, seeks help from the only person who can get Ollie out of his funk, that person being Grace.",

    "description": "The Sutton and Bailey families are getting an early Christmas present: Honey is well enough to come home, they hope for good, after spending a year at the sanatorium. Honey wants to resume her life in New Bedford just they way she left it, but it ends up not being as simple as that. With the hair dressing shop, all of her customers have gone elsewhere and the general consensus amongst the townsfolk is that Honey is still \"contagious\" from her tuberculosis. Her children are a year older, and Hub in particular is verging on manhood. Honey doesn't like the fact that Hub is showing so much attention to Alice, who Honey feels should be supported by the baby's biological father regardless of the suitability of him as a father or husband. Ultimately, Honey comes to the realization that she is treating Alice the way that the townsfolk are treating her. Meanwhile, Eddy has some grand plans for the pawn shop. Based in part by some comments by May and by Eddy himself, Maisey begins to have doubts about her father's sincerity of leading a straight life and feels that the pawn shop scheme may be a way to abscond with some of her money. And Toppy doesn't want to admit to herself or Archie in particular that she is going through \"the change\" in life - menopause - and as such decides to self-medicate herself rather than follow doctor's orders.",

    "description": "Doris, Toppy's daughter, comes back to New Bedford during a break from school in Toronto. Spoiled Doris acts as if the world has dealt her a rotten hand in life, especially that the disintegration of her parent's marriage has placed her in a lower social standing among the elite class in Toronto. She hasn't even been invited to the Winter Ball - the social event of the season in Toronto - she feels because of her parent's situation. Even Hub has been invited to the ball by the Bridgemans as their guest. Hub really likes Laura and really wants to go, but feels that he's a little out of his element. These issues may be immaterial as he doesn't have the proper attire and Max and Honey can't afford to buy it for him. His relatives do whatever they can for Hub, and May comes through buying his clothes saying that he will represent the Bailey family at the event. This irks Doris, who feels like the family will do anything for Hub but nothing for her. Doris also brings news from her father for Toppy, Bob who wants to speed up the divorce by providing evidence for her as to his adultery. As Toppy decides what to do, she learns about impropriety and hypocrisy as she learns what happened to best friend Althea the year she went away to school and why she is now so protective about Laura. As Laura and Althea wait for Hub at the train station to head to Toronto, Hub is delayed as he attends to a distressed Alice and may miss the train as he looks after his friend.",

    "description": "Valentine's Day 1936 is approaching and Max is directing this year's edition of the Valentine's Follies. Against this backdrop, romantic relationships are formed and broken. Toppy is not feeling much in a romantic Valentine's mood as she has just returned from Toronto with her signed divorce papers in hand. Archie, however, has other ideas. He proposes to her that he, when appropriate, will ask her to marry him. Although she knew that he would eventually ask her, she was not prepared to actually hear the words. She is also not prepared for her encounter with Mother Attenborough, which not only threatens the unofficial proposal (to which Toppy did not really answer), but also Toppy and Archie's relationship altogether. Alice gives birth to a baby boy, who she names Jacob. She nor her family have the means to keep Jacob, and everyone, including Dr. Barlow and her mother, convinces her that she does need to give him away to a family that can take care of him. When that time comes, she refuses and does whatever she can to keep him. When all avenues are exhausted, she comes to some realizations including that she does need to give him away and needs to leave New Bedford to start a new life. With the former, she chooses a couple with whom she thinks she can trust. With the latter, Hub tells her his true feelings as she departs town. Female shy Jim is facing his sixth Valentine's Day without his deceased wife, Kathleen, but he does have Pritchard and unfortunately for him his in-laws, Louey and Rose Pritchard, who are coming for a visit to New Bedford from Niagara Falls. The reason for the Pritchard's visit is to take Pritchard back to Niagara Falls with them as they feel Jim is an unsuitable parent for their grandson. Pritchard does whatever he can to stay with his father including enlisting Grace in a ruse, the ruse which ultimately backfires. However, Rose, away from the arguments between Louey and Jim, confides to Jim about his father-in-law and convinces him that after six years without Kathleen he needs to get on with his life. Resulting from this talk between Rose and Jim, perhaps Grace will get her first ever Valentine's Day card from a real beau, and perhaps Jim and Grace can get beyond calling each other \"Miss Bailey\" and \"Mr. Flett\".",

    "description": "Fat is feeling grown up, yet no one is treating him as such. To show himself he is, he gets into a gambling ring of older youth and quickly gets swindled not only of some of his mother's pocket change, but his hat and his new pair of shoes. Not able to tell his parents, he refuses help from Hub in getting his things back. Fat ends up getting some unexpected and anonymous help. Honey is feeling alienated as some people are still treating her like a leper because of her past tuberculosis. She wants to reopen her hairdressing business but Callie refuses to rent the old hairdressing space back out to her. Max decides to employ a little psychology to get the Cramps to rent the space back to Honey. And Grace is feeling abandoned. It's been two months since she and Jim had their first tender kiss at the Valentine's Follies, but he has not approached her since. He later admits to her that he isn't ready to start dating yet as he still thinks about his deceased wife, Kathleen. Just at that moment, wealthy, suave and handsome Vanaver Mainwairing is passing through New Bedford, and upon his first sighting of Grace mutters the word \"perfect\" to describe her. He confesses to Grace that it is love at first sight as he sweeps her off her feet. May is suspicious of Van's intentions, and is even more suspicious after she meets him. After five days of their initial meeting, Van asks Grace to marry him. She is somewhat cautious before she gives him her answer, her answer regardless of her mother's feelings.",

    "description": "Hub receives a reward for a past good deed. Enjoying the feeling that he significantly altered the life of a total stranger in a positive way, he continues to do good deeds, helping out a stranded adolescent transient girl, Fiona McCaul. This good deed in turn results in another windfall for Hub. Although not doing it for \"rewards\", Hub ponders how he can continue to do good in his life. His mother has reopened her hairdressing salon, but business is non-existent due in part to her competition, Pearl Disher, undercutting her prices. The Suttons believe advertising will help matters. Max makes Fat wear a sandwich board advertisement, but Honey thinks the best advertising is a woman with a beautifully set head of hair. And a strain has come between May and Grace over Grace's letter stating that she is going to marry Van regardless of if May provides her blessing. May, not wanting to be on bad terms with her only daughter, does eventually give her blessing. However, May is still wary of Van, she not being the only one in town. Pritchard is angry with Grace for abandoning him and Jim. And Jim is sombre about Grace's news, but is also suspicious about the mysterious stranger. Although May and Grace settle their differences about Grace getting married, they can't agree on anything about the wedding itself. Feeling like she's being treated like a little child by May, Grace decides to elope. Brought on in part by the stress of the situation, May has a few \"spells\" and ends up suffering a stroke while Grace is away at the Justice of the Peace's office.",

The question now remains is who will take care of May during her recovery period, May who needs around the clock supervision. Bob, the only surviving son, refuses to even come back to New Bedford unless his mother is on her deathbed. Honey, the martyr, wants to take primary responsibility as she feels she owes May, who paid for all her hospital bills. Max agrees that Honey should do her fair share, but also feels that she has a responsibility to take care of her own family and what priorities that entails. Grace feels responsible as May's daughter, but no one wants her to sacrifice herself in this, the early stage of her marriage, especially since she and Van were supposed to live in Toronto. Maisey wants to do her share as she wants to show everyone that she is responsible enough to take care of herself despite she being a minor; she's concerned that if May is not well enough to take care of her, that the authorities will send her away. The one person who feels trapped to take care of May as the independent one without others to take care of is Toppy. She feels like life is now closing in on her and that others will think her selfish if she refuses to take any responsibility. She decides to go see a psychiatrist, psychiatry which Dr. Barlow calls \"trick cycling\", to talk about her feelings. Because of these secretive trips, Archie thinks she's seeing another man romantically. Finally, Max thinks it a good idea to convene all the players and map out a strategy for May's care. May beats them all to the punch as, well enough to write a letter through Hub, states that she will hire a full-time live-in nurse.",

    "description": "While one female leaves town, two arrive. The departure is Grace, who has moved with Van to his summer house outside of Toronto. Jim is still grieving his loss of Grace and vows to be more assertive in his life by seizing opportunities. The first arrival is Rebecca 'Becca' Graham, a precocious new girl in Fat and Pritchard's class. For both boys, it's love at first sight, and they battle for Rebecca's affections. As she is attracted in part to intelligence, Pritchard has the initial upper hand. However, Fat, who now wants to be called Henry in front of Rebecca to seem more mature, vows to turn over a new leaf in his life by pursuing intellectual activities. He has a natural aptitude for chess, which Max fosters. After Henry and Pritchard have a physical altercation - Henry punches Pritchard since Pritchard won't stop calling him Fat - Pritchard thinks the only manly way to settle their battle is a game of chess. The second new arrival is Juanita 'Nita' Bascombe, May's new private nurse. Nita's arrival is timely as Lorna MacFarlane, who is currently looking after May, shows her anger toward the Baileys because of the mine accident which blinded Eugene and thus changed the MacFarlane's lives. But Nita catches all of New Bedford by surprise as the town's first Negro resident. Nita is also progressive in her nursing, employing restorative physical therapy on May despite it not being on Dr. Barlow's written instructions. May is a difficult patient as she finds the therapy difficult and tiring without any sign of improvement. And Maisey is initially suspect of Nita, the stranger in the house, but Nita eventually gets Maisey on her side. Although Dr. Barlow wants to replace Nita with a nurse who will follow his orders, May and Maisey follow Nita's instructions as May has a breakthrough.",

    "description": "Grace and Van arrive at Lakeview, Van's grand summer house on the shores of Lake Ontario. There, Grace meets for the first time a collection of servants and house guests: Paloma, the Spanish cook/housekeeper; Frederick, the mute chauffeur and butler; Nigel Moss, the proper English gentleman friend; and Enzo, an Italian operatic baritone. Enzo is only his stage name and persona to the outside world, as he is really Stewart McGregor, a Scottish Haligonian who he thinks would not be able to sell tickets to an Italian opera audience. One of Van's friends, Harry Turnbull, plays an elaborate practical joke on Van, which if successful would have seen Van spend a couple of days in jail. Van discovers the ruse and he and his house guests thinks it would be great fun to play an equally elaborate joke back on Turnbull. The plan they ultimately devise is based around the fact that Grace bears a striking resemblance to exiled Spanish Princess Eboli; Nigel has a painting of the Princess, and even Grace thinks the resemblance is uncanny. Grace is to act the part of the Princess, despite she not knowing any Spanish, to a third party, namely Jane and Willie Easterbrook who are friends and business acquaintances of Turnbull. The plan is to bilk the Easterbrooks out of a sizable amount of money, only temporarily (however Van and Nigel plan to use some of the moneys to help Paloma's imprisoned brother get out of jail). Turnbull, based on a pledge, will have to pay the Easterbrooks back for their losses. Grace is a nervous but willing participant. Despite a few bumps in the road of the ploy, they pull it off successfully, and manage to get even more money from the Easterbrooks than they originally devised. Unbeknownst to Grace, her band of pranksters, including Van, are not exactly who and what they seem. But Van admits to Nigel that a fortunate or unfortunate consequence of what started out solely as a convenience is that he wants to start a new life with his wife, for whom he is falling deeper in love.",

    "description": "The men in the Sutton household are facing problems with the respective women in their lives. Henry likes Rebecca and anonymously has been writing her romantic, poetic letters, which she loves. She not only loves the letters themselves but also the mystery. But when she mentions that she'd like to find out who her secret admirer is, Pritchard pipes up that the letters are from him. Fuming, Henry decides that he needs to get back at Pritchard, which he manages to do with a little help from Hub. In the natural evolution of Hub and Laura's relationship, she is waiting for him to give her his newly acquired athletics letter, but that is the farthest thing from his mind. Not that he doesn't like Laura in that way or wants to give the letter to anyone else, but he's been preoccupied about what he wants to do with his life, namely joining the priesthood, an idea he has yet to tell to anyone. But with a little advice from Max, Hub decides what to do with respect to Laura at least during this stage of his life. And Max and Honey hit a bump in their relationship when one of Honey's doctors at the sanatorium, Dr. Thomas Asher - or \"Tommy\" as Honey refers to him - comes to New Bedford on extended business. Honey is excited to see her old friend, whom she credits for keeping her sane during her hospitalization. After Tommy comes to the Sutton house for dinner - a dinner with conversation dominated between Tommy and Honey - Max and Honey have an argument about Tommy's role in Honey's life, which she admits is not perfect with Max. She also admits that Tommy talks to her about things that Max never does. This argument threatens Max's surprise anniversary dinner with his wife. Tommy later admits to Honey that he does have feelings for her, which catches her by surprise. But with help from Toppy, Max and Honey come to a new understanding in their loving relationship. Meanwhile, Toppy hires Rebecca, the banker's daughter, to do her books at the store, Rebecca who at her early age wants to save money to go to Hollywood to be an actress. Toppy needs the help as she has been secretly writing a book in her spare time about how she sees life.",

    "description": "Jim is trying a new looser attitude and with it comes a new looser look in his attire. Toppy has finished her book and has sent it unsolicited to a publisher. Henry is looking for new chess challenges. And Callie wants to win and influence friends, at least that's what the title of the book she's reading infers. After meddling in one private conversation after another in an effort to make and influence friends, Callie does manage to have a meaningful discussion, this one with Hub, who tells her that he is thinking about becoming a priest. Beyond Father Fitzroy at the local Catholic church, Callie is the first person he's told. Another person who wants to influence people is Max. Mayor Johnson has passed away, and Archie, representing the town council and on advice from May, asks Max if he would be interested in running for mayor. After thinking about it, Max agrees. It looks as if he may not need his influencing skills to win the election since he looks to run uncontested. However after a political argument with Alden, Alden decides that he too will run for mayor. After their political debate at which Max seems to have the upper hand in terms of popular support, Alden feels Max's primary political strength is the backing of the town's strongest voice, that being May. In an effort to help her husband in the election, Callie takes advantage of her newfound friendship with Hub and tells May of Hub's life plans. May, the devout Presbyterian, confronts Hub, Honey and Max about Hub's plans; May ultimately decides to disinherit Hub not so much for not wanting to take his rightful place as the head of the mine, but because he wants to devote his life to Catholicism. Honey - who was born Catholic - and Max stand by their son, which makes May withdraw her support for Max's mayoral candidacy. Callie thinks she has her wish but ends up losing her newfound friend in the process. But Callie's end goal may not be achieved based on a discussion about honesty, love and kindness between May and Juanita.",

    "description": "Grace returns to New Bedford. She is suspect of Juanita's method of rehabilitation for her mother. Grace feels that such work will give May false hope about recuperation. However, May's determination convinces Grace that Juanita may be right. Jim, with his new outlook on life, strikes up a friendship with Audrey Collins, the chess coach for nearby North Bridge. Jim is happily surprised that Audrey is as attracted to him as he is to her. Jack Miller makes a short stopover in New Bedford on his way to Halifax to catch a boat to Europe. He is running the marathon for the Canadian Olympic team at the upcoming games in Berlin. Hub strikes a friendship with Jack, who confides to Hub that his real name is Jacob Milski and is Jewish. Hub doesn't understand why Jack is so secretive of his heritage, especially since Jack is proud to be Jewish. Despite the Nazi uprising in Germany, Jack is not afraid for his safety, but rather wants to prove to Hitler that Jews are not inferior to Aryans, namely his two German competitors. But Hub wonders how much Jack can prove, win or lose the race, if he doesn't declare his Jewish heritage. Henry is continuing his love of chess. He is still undefeated until he loses to a competitor from North Bridge. He is devastated but is determined to get better, and ultimately win the upcoming provincials at the beginning of the school year. He needs some coaching, but he is already better than everyone else in New Bedford, until... Enter Eddie Jackson. Eddie initially feigns ignorance of chess but eventually admits to Maisey that he actually does know the game and knows it quite well. He learned the game in prison and winning was a matter of survival. Max is suspect of how good one can learn a game such as chess in prison, until Eddie simultaneously beats in order Max, Pritchard, Jim and Henry in four concurrent games. But Eddie initially declines the offer to mentor Henry since chess is a reminder of a time in his life he'd rather forget. Henry's persistence does win over Eddie. Eddie proves to be a tough teacher, but that in combination with the lure of his friends having fun in the summer sun makes Henry rebel against chess altogether. But a move by Jack, now known to Hitler and the world as Jacob, shows Henry that he needs to persevere if he wants to achieve his goals.",

The entire town of New Bedford is excited as the annual bass fishing tournament, sponsored by Silver Dome Mine, and the associated picnic, sponsored by the bank, is upcoming. Combined, they are the biggest economic event of the year for New Bedford as it draws tourists to the area. On a more serious note, infantile paralysis is slowly spreading through the region, but public health officials are uncertain of the source of the infections. The closest case is in Pinebury, 30 miles away. The current heatwave does not help the matter, the heat which exacerbates the rate of infection. On advice from Dr. Barlow, Max, as Mayor, wants to issue a public health warning, with cautions of children being in large crowds or near bodies of water, two seeming causes of infection outbreaks. The merchants association in general is angry that Max would issue such a warning as the infection has not yet hit New Bedford and they know such a warning would negatively affect attendance at the tournament and picnic. Honey takes the warning to heart and orders both Henry and Violet to stay indoors until further notice. Henry disobeys orders, and with Violet and Zach in tow, goes outside for a brief period. With information that affected children vacationed at Bass Lake and without Dr. Barlow who is away and out of contact, Juanita suggests in front of the merchants association that the tournament be canceled. Matters gets worse when Zach comes down with symptoms of the infection. In private, Max chastises Henry for putting 'his only son' at risk despite medical evidence stating that Zach could not have come down with symptoms so quickly after exposure. With help from May, Max and Honey quarantine Zach at the hospital in North Bridge. But in public, Max the mayor needs to act. Without Dr. Barlow or any public health official to offer advice, Max decides to persuade May and Otto Graham, the bank manager, to cancel their respective events. Both are wary of doing so, especially without conclusive evidence from medical health. And the militant merchants association, the opposition led by Archie, Callie, Myrt Dumphry and Sam Wilamot, does whatever it can to keep both events going, with some individuals taking drastic measures. Finally, both May and Otto issue their official cancellation/postponement of the events, and Jim, in his new capacity, manages to take the health warning to the masses, much to Callie's consternation. In the end, Zach ends up not being infected and Dr. Barlow, upon his return, applauds both Juanita and Max's actions despite the differences he has had with Juanita in the past.",

    "description": "The annual Bell Award ceremony is taking place in New Bedford this year. Toppy is the Mistress of Ceremonies and entertainment coordinator, the latter task she is finding difficult due to lack of talent. She has Rebecca doing a Shakespearean reading, and that's about all. Maisey, the daughter of a saloon singer, wants to audition, but Toppy is skeptical of Maisey's talent or lack thereof. Toppy does eventually allow Maisey to audition but one setback after another prevents the audition from happening until it's too close to the actual event to hold auditions. Toppy just has to hope that Maisey's as good as she says she is. As the mayor's wife, Honey is supposed to present the Bell Award to the recipient. Honey, not a natural public speaker, wants to do a good job, that is until she finds out who this year's recipient of the award is. And Hub comes back from his month long work stint at the lumber mill at Alawanda. Laura is angry with him since he did not write as he promised he would. Along with Hub is Travis Hampton, who worked and bunked with Hub at the lumber mill. On Hub's recommendation, Travis got a temporary job at the the Silver Dome Mine. Hub looks up to Travis since Travis managed to get better conditions for the workers at the mill. However, when Travis starts to rally the workers against management at Silver Dome, he and Hub become on opposing sides as Hub is a shareholder of the mine. Travis leads the workers in what seems to be unreasonable demands, but the workers believe that Travis can get them what he states. There are some on the Board of Silver Dome, especially Lawrence Bridgeman, who want to take a firm stance against the workers. May, however, realizes that some of the workers' demands are valid. The Board approves some of demands but not all. Travis convinces the workers to decline the offer and go on strike. Tensions rise when the standoff seems unresolvable without the use of police force and without the use of scab workers. Travis further goes one step too far in Hub's mind when he goes after Laura, who accepts Travis' advances to get back at Hub. Finally, all is settled when May exposes Travis for who he really is and after Hub suggests an innovative solution. These acts combined help to heal the rift between May, Hub and the Suttons and makes Honey's presentation speech at the award ceremony all the more meaningful.",

    "description": "Showdown in Durango, the latest adventures of Saturday serial character the Masked Rider, is showing at the local theater. Buck Howard aka the Masked Rider, is in New Bedford promoting the latest installment, his promotional activities including a radio interview with Jim, and a public appearance in character at the theater. Jim is excited as he, along with many of the kids of New Bedford, is a big fan of the serial. He quickly loses his idolatry of Buck Howard as Buck is a boorish drunk. When Buck is found drunk just before his scheduled interview, Callie talks Jim, who has a talent for mimicry of the Masked Rider, into interviewing himself as both interviewer and the Masked Rider. The ruse works. When the scheduled public appearance at the theater is supposed to happen, Buck once again is found drunk. It's going to be a little more difficult for Jim to appear as the Masked Rider in person, but he manages to pull it off hidden behind the costume and mask. But Jim's second ruse may be compromised when Buck awakens from his drunken stupor and stumbles out to the theater. Rebecca, usually a fan of any movie, has other things on her mind. She increasingly needs to take care of her mother, who suffers from agoraphobia and as such is housebound. Rebecca is ashamed of her mother, but when Honey and Toppy find out about Mrs. Graham's situation, they offer Rebecca and her mother their support. And Grace and Van are passing through the area. Van is checking out investment opportunities at the Alawanda Lumber Mill, while Grace visits in New Bedford with family and friends. While Van is away, Grace receives a reply from Mr. and Mrs. Mainwairing to May's invitation, the response being that there must be an error since their son, Vanaver, died five years earlier. Confused, Grace thinks that Paloma can clear up the misunderstanding. As Grace telephones Lakeview, Xavier, not knowing that he is speaking to Grace, answers the phone stating that Lakeview is the Porter household. Further confused, Grace feels that she needs to go to Lakeview. There, she finds \"Paloma\" out of character. Paloma, as Mildred Quintero, confesses to Grace the entire truth: that Harry Turnbull does not exist, that the people she met at Lakeview, including Van, are a group of grifters, and that they really did swindle the Easterbrooks of all the money. But Mildred also tells Grace that Van, or whatever his real name is, wants to leave grifting as he really does love Grace and he wants to live a straight life with her. When Grace next sees Van, she hasn't decided yet what to do.",

    "description": "It seems as if secrets are running rampant in New Bedford. Toppy has just received copies of her just published book, but besides Honey and Grace, she does not want anyone to know that she is Lucinda Fairchild - the nom de plume she's used - until the book is well received. Grace discovers Van's secrets, which she confronts him about. Since Grace obviously knows the truth, he does not deny it. Toppy and by accident Rebecca are the only ones to whom Grace has confided about Van's real identity and the associated end of her marriage. Grace definitely does not want anyone else to know, including May, who, if she found out, would probably decline in health. But Grace may not be able to keep this a secret in the town as she has kicked Van out of the house and the only place he can go in town is the New Bedford Hotel, owned and managed by the town gossip, Callie, who will suspect something if Van checks in by himself. Despite Van's declaration of love for her, Grace convinces Van to leave New Bedford, saying that he will do so if he loves her. But a story from Rebecca about another of her movie plots may make Grace change her mind. The latest health issue facing May - an elevated blood pressure - is due to the fact that the mine is facing some competition and can only compete with an influx of money into the company. May wants to keep the news of the company's problems from its workers. With the company facing low and declining stock prices, it is not issued a loan from the bank. However a surprise buy up of stock from an unknown purchaser - which pushes up the stock price - keeps the mine afloat for at least the time being; the company still needs an influx of cash. Meanwhile, Jim continues his courtship with Audrey. Pritchard doesn't much like her, but he comes to the realization that it's not because of her as a person, but because she's not Grace.",

    "description": "A chain letter is circulating around New Bedford. Some of the recipients are taking it seriously, some not so much so. There are some serious decisions taking place in the Sutton household. Hub is still thinking about becoming a priest, and his parents want to make sure he knows what that entails - especially with regards to female romantic relationships - and they want him to experience some of what life has to offer a young man before making a decision. Father Fitzroy is convinced Hub has the calling, and Laura is more relieved that it is Hub's thoughts about his life rather than her that has caused him to be as distant as he has been of late. Honey and Max each want to make major career changes but realistically only one can be achieved at this time; Max unilaterally makes the decision in favor of his wife's wants. Grace knows what she wants, and that is Van out of her life, despite she telling him that she wanted to work things out. Silver Dome Mine is still facing its financial crisis, but May, George and Grace think they have a plan to weather them through the rough financial times. Grace uses the mine's troubles as a front to give Van a taste of his own medicine. With a little help from Jim, Grace successfully carries out her scheme. However, Van knows more about what Grace is doing than he lets on. When Grace confesses to Van what she's done to him, Van in turn exposes the greed of those he has past swindled. Van still loves Grace but doesn't like what he's done to her. As such, he decides to choose a new worthwhile life path without his love. But Van is not totally out of Grace's life. And when Grace finally tells her mother the truth about Van and her marriage, Grace does not receive the reaction she was expecting.",
