    "description": "Reno Raines saves Boone, who was run off the road in a strange accident. Boone invites him to his place - only to snicker into Reno's papers, discovering he is a man on the run. Later at Highwater's local bar, Boone shows his real self - a violent robber and mugger. Reno stops him the hard way, forces him to give back what he had taken from the other people, and throws him out of town. Boone denounces Reno to the Sheriff of the next county as a wanted man, so they arrest him. Through a girl Reno had met, to whom he had given Bobby Sixkiller, he manages to warn Bobby, and Bobby tricks the Sheriff into releasing Reno. Meanwhile, Boone kidnapped the girl - Tina, daughter of Highwater's Sheriff - and forces Reno to let him beat Reno up in a humiliating manner. Despite injured badly, Reno goes back intent to find the girl, and gets into another physical confrontation with Boone. When Boone is arrested by Tina's father, Tina's brother shoots Boone dead point blank. Reno Raines prepares himself to take the blame on himself - but Sheriff Wendell twists the arm of the law a bit, and is backed by the entire population of Highwater.

He escapes from custody, crosses Mexico, and enters the frontier city of Nogales, between Mexico and the United States. When he is making phone call to his wife Serena, he is intercepted by an armed man, they fight, and Villas ends up killing the man with his own gun - only to discover he was a Mexican policeman, Luis Diego. Mexico issues an international bounty for Villas, and Reno Raines gets on the case. By following Serena, he is able to catch Villas rather quickly, but so are a group of man in a 4x4, who shoot at them from afar. They escape that, and a second attack even within a convent's walls. Reno realizes that his target may not be the butcher the Latin press of Nogales presents him as, and accepts that Villas is a man with a case similar to his own - a former police officer who discovered corruption, and who got framed by his corrupt colleagues for crimes he didn't commit. Gomez and other officers are the men on the hunt - and for a prize more valuable than the US$ 100,000 put on Villas' head.",

    "description": "Jimmy Warren was so proud of his work on a hot rod, that he put his initial on it, J! The owner of the bike refused to pay the repair and maintenance work, and stabbed the young man in the chest, killing him. Reno Raines was after a young woman escaping justice, and fins a \"mother courage\" vowing revenge on her killer's son. So, Reno infiltrates the gang of bikers who do drug smuggling on the side, to try and find out which one of them stabbed the teenage mechanic to death. The police have almost given up on the case, but Georgia, his grieving mother, hasn't, and apart from offering a reward to anyone who may provide information leading to the murderer, she's doing her own investigation. Reno offers an oil painting of a horse and a biker to the leader of the gang he suspects, and the man lets him plant it in his office, unawares that a small microphone is relating all his conversations with the traffickers, and the trucks' dispatcher to the Sheriff's office. That leads to a great showdown of state police and DEA agents, to get all the baddies with their hands on the white powder. This time Reno is not rewarded with a love kiss by the sexy young mother, as Georgia is reunited with her husband in the end.",

Lieutenant Dutch Dixon receives this information before anybody else does, and keeps it from leaking into the media. Dixon and his corrupt police force use this as an opportunity to set a trap to bait Reno out into the open, creating a false media story that Val has regained consciousness. Although reluctant and suspicious as first, Reno feels he has no choice but to check out the story, and ends up getting arrested, falling right into their trap. Dixon goes as far as to plan an elaborate jail house execution of Reno, but he is able to thwart this scheme with the help of some friends.",

    "description": "A young lady driver must stop in a desert road with a flat tire. When trying awkwardly to deal with it, she sees a tall biker stopping by, and reacts with fear. Soon, Vincent Black gains the confidence of Carol Atkins, and changes the wheel. Next, she's getting in sexy black lingerie, and waiting for a date in her place - but she's attacked by an unseen person, and stabbed to death. Sheriff Jack Durham is a good man, but not so bright, and besides his judgment is impaired because he was very fond of Carol - a neglected housewife. Circunstancial evidence leads to Black's arrest; Carol's husband seems more intent of expedite justice than mourning his loss. Black will give the Sheriff a lesson on police inquests at the crime scene. A cell-mate will help Black to hide from the Sheriff the fax with the January 1992 reward notice: «WANTED Reno Raines - Wanted for the murder of a police officer - Contact Lt. Dutch Dixon 555-6792 - $10,000 Policemen's Fund Reward». Cheyenne will come up with the best theory about the murderer, and she will dress up sexier than her usual to attract the attention of a so called photography teacher. Thus, she becomes the next target of a serial killer.",
