The gang is surprised to find Quirkistan a dreary wasteland; it turns out that the land is enchanted, and the weather and states of things are determined solely by the mood of king Mamoud, Quirkistan's bratty boy ruler. He's currently brooding over missing his birthday party, and as a result, the whole land is doomed. So, with the prospect of a rich treasure reward, the gang tries to cheer up the king. Aladdin comes close with his risky sword-juggling act, but only Jasmine's storytelling can engage Mamoud. But Jasmine will have to stay there and entertain Mamoud forever!",

There Aladdin and his gang follow a rainbow and find at the end that its abundant clouds are magically controlled by the jungle queen, rain bird Thundra. She is instantly smitten with uninterested Iago, who is nevertheless -against Jasmine's leap- tricked into asking her for rain, and after she refuses keeps her busy while Genie steals a cloud.

Still, when a bones-reader predicts Aladdin can find a treasure at full moon on an island, just the evening he promised to take Jasmine 'just us two', he's happy to take Iago's excuse: an island is a romantic retreat. Genie and carpet secretly tag along, searching while he keeps Jasmine -not quite- amused, but soon she notices and allows the gang to continue treasure-hunting. Only when the monstrous guardian werewolf turns into a pretty girl in startled Aladdin's arms, his princess comes close to turning into loveless monster...",

Worse, she brought Agrabah a black magical 'gift': a giant black obelisk, the shadow of which makes everything it touches disappear, and nothing Genie tries can break or move it. Then Mirage tells Aladdin the only remedy is the mirror which reflects the truth behind the appearance, to be found on the roof of the world. The gang minus Genie fly till they find the ice cage full of mirrors, and Aladdin chooses one which shows him back in street rat costume. When they return and the mirror successfully removes shadow and obelisk, Princess Jasmine finds her fear was justified that's all too easy: now Mirage tells her true plan was to create an elaborate trick-reality to mislead them while the real Agrabah is wiped out, but Genie and Aladdin also have a surprising trick up their sleeves...",

    "description": "While Aladdin and Carpet flew higher then ever, Abu and Iago made such a mess in the palace that Jasmine and Aladdin nearly persuaded the Sultan to throw them out of the palace. Then fairies arrive, who busily show a magical mess is even worse, only it takes a while 'til people realize their mischief is not the gang's work. They prove well-meaning but infantile, as playful and tireless as puppies, but magical fliers who can give Aladdin and the amused royals sky-rides, making Carpet feel superfluous, while Iago's attempt to make Abu feast with table-manners goes wrong in no time. Alas, the fairies won't accept the humans get tired and want to return, instead they lift the whole palace 'so you must never leave' and trick Genie into a knot, unable to stop it crashing down when the fairies leave because their playmates refuse to keep frolicking, only Carpet tries to save them smashing to smithereens inside the falling palace...",

The monkey was the unappreciated main income of Minos's circus act, who picked the audience's pockets, and one day Aladdin's nearly empty purse. Impressed with Aladdin's performance getting it back, and even stealing Minos's full purse, Minos's accomplice Fatima convinces him to enlist the street rat as purse-snatcher, and indeed he does better then Abu, who is now further scorned. Only ever fair and generous newbie Aladdin generously shares his -half- share with the monkey. Hearing a victim's desperate family weep they are cleaned out, Aladdin donates them the rest of his profit. Next morning Aladdin refuses to continue that way, and is surprised the circus gang agrees: instead he is sent into the temple, to pass the elaborate traps and get the magical stone...",

The three thieves have been transformed into criminally genial monsters, who cause havoc in all Agrabah, unstoppable, even invading the Sultan's palace.

When the giant prince Grobertus of Stenchenia arrives by yak to bid for the princess's hand, she and the sultan welcome him, although he and his traditional courting reek insufferably after terribly old cheese. When Aladdin claims to be her fiancée, the prince challenges him to a traditional duel by spiky club, but Jasmine says her hand is only won by kindness- when Aladdin says he's the friendliest, she scorns him again and grants the prince an evening. Aladdin 'advices' him deliberately badly, but the royals are determined to sit trough the Stenchenian customs, and Jasmine notices Aladdin and Genie, so she makes him throw a melon at that window. Iago makes the giant believe the vines from the oasis are the ideal courting gift. Aladdin takes her and the gang to save the prince and his yak, Iago and Abu try again to steal the ring, but that proves to be fixed into the nose of a gigantic monster, the vines are its hair...",
