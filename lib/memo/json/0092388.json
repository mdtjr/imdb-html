    "description": "Kurt Olsson and his cameraman Arne start broadcasting Kurt Olsson's Television from a small cottage beside the switch yard at the Gothenburg railway station. Kurt hasn't got any permission from his sister-in-law to use her cottage. In the middle of the show she turns up, is very upset, but cannot stop the program. The show contains a series of recurring pieces. In \"This Is My Life\" Kurt shows the razed stones of his childhood home. In \"Sweden in Real Life\" Kurt reports from a platform at the railway station. In enthusiastic words he describes the electrified atmosphere in the crowd waiting for the train. When the train arrives, he interviews passengers and the engineer about the fantastic trip. In \"Pottering\" Kurt shows how to make a bonnet that can protect the hair from getting greasy, when you are frying bacon. The musical parts of the show are performed by Kurt Olsson's Lady Orchestra. He treats the female musicians in a condescending way, except his favorite Gudrun. Accompanied by the orchestra Kurt sings two of Siw Malmkvist's old hits.",

Gudrun is going with them in the car, but the rest of the Lady Orchestra has to walk, carrying all their musical instruments. In the series \"This Is My Life\" Kurt returns to his childhood schoolyard. He shows how his classmates used to let out the air of the headmaster's bike, and he being unjustly accused of it. In the tour around the big TV-house, Kurt this time shows the painters' workshop and the joinery in an inadequate way. In the series \"Sweden in Real Life\" Kurt reports from the yard of the big car industry in Gothenburg. Kurt says that the air smells fresh, although a fir tree and a bear die in the background. In today's \"Pottery\" Kurt shows how to turn an inner tube of a bike into a fitness tool. Accompanied by the Lady Orchestra Kurt sings two old hits, originally performed by Nona Brockstedt and Siw Malmkvist.",

In the series \"This Is My Life\" Kurt shows his old workplace at the storage in the Eriksberg dockyard, where he doesn't give the workers the tools they ask for. In the series \"How to make television\" he shows a control room at the big TV studio. A red light signals that a live broadcast is going on, but Kurt ignores this and enters the studio. Siwert Öholm is interviewing the prime minister, while others try to get Kurt out of the studio. But Kurt goes straight up to the prime minister, and starts interviewing him for Kurt Olsson's Television. In the series \"Sweden in Real Life\" Kurt visits the bridge in a ferry at Gothenburg harbor. When he tries to start the machinery, the ferry capsizes and sinks to the bottom. In today's \"Pottery\" Kurt shows how to transform an empty plastic vessel into a flower vase. . Accompanied by the Lady Orchestra Kurt sings two old hits, originally performed by Sven-Gösta Jonsson and Siw Malmkvist.",
