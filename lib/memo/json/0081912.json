    "description": "Del employs younger brother Rodney as a member of Trotters' Independent Traders, despite warnings from his business colleagues. When Rodney decides to become the Trotters' financial adviser - monitoring the accounts and keeping Del's dodgy dealings in check - Del has second thoughts about their partnership. Cracks show in the partnership when Rodney inadvertently bungles a deal with Trigger. But despite Del's anger, it turns out that Rodder's advice would have prevented the purchase of 25 briefcases that are locked with the serial number inside. Del and Rodney have yet another row and 'Little Bruv' plans a career change. Desperate to make his mark on the world, Rodney decides to leave for Hong Kong - a great plan, if only he'd remembered his passport.",

    "description": "Del and Rodney are once again hunting for bargains. And after stopping off at Boycie's car lot they spy a Mark II Cortina that's being used as a part-exchange for a Vanden Plas. Del knocks the asking price down to £25, so long as he houses Boycie's E type jag for a week - Del hopes to use the Jag to impress his bit on the side. Del ups the price tag of the Cortina to £199 and gets interest from an Australian buyer. And with cash in their pockets, a Jag to drive, and both of them single, Rodney talks Del into heading off for a night on the tiles. The Trotters' night out doesn't start too well, as they are chatted up by a pair of transvestites in a nightclub. But their luck changes in the form of Nicky and Michelle, who they manage to chat up and persuade them to write their telephone numbers on Del's cigar pack, with the promise of a date next Friday. On their way home, Rodney accidentally throws the cigar pack out of the window of the Jag, and when Del makes an emergency stop, a car smashes into the back of Boycie's pristine E-type. To top it off, the car responsible for writing-off the Jag is none other than the clapped out Cortina.",

After a dance at the Camberwell Chamber of Trade, Del and Vimmal are cornered by Mr Ram and his heavy boys. It seems that Vimmal is holding onto a pricey porcelain family heirloom that belongs to the Ram family - and they want it back. In order to make an impression, Del offers to mediate between the two men, especially because Mr Ram is willing to pay four grand for the return of the statue to his family. Unluckily for Del the four grand is just a ruse and he ends up losing a fortune to Vimmal and Mr Ram, a couple of con men touring the country using the same scam on local businessmen wherever they go.",

Despite their engagement, Pauline left Del for another Mod with a faster scooter. But with her return, Del is willing to forgive and forget, and it's not long before they are engaged again - much to the disapproval of Rodney and Grandad. Things get worse when Pauline moves into the flat and refuses to do her share of the housework. As her behaviour becomes unbearable, Rodders and Gramps leave for Auntie Rose's cottage in Clacton. Del hears rumours about a recent police investigation into the death of Pauline's former husband (Bobby Finch), and when Pauline urges him to take out life insurance, a frightened Del heads for Clacton, leaving an eviction notice for his fiancée.",

As part of the deal, Rodney has to suffer the nerve-jangling experience of patrolling the bus station on Tyler Street throughout the night. The next part of Del's scheme is the launch of Trotters' Ethnic Tours: a scenic tour around Chingford and Croydon, taking in such ethnic sights as the Lee Valley Viaduct. And despite a great deal of whinging from his family, Del persuades Rodney to drive the bus, whilst Grandad agrees to distribute the publicity leaflets. But when nobody turns up to the launch of Trotters' Ethnic Tours, it is revealed that Grandad shares the legendary Trotter business acumen and has posted the advertising leaflets through the dust chute of Mandela House.",

    "description": "When Trigger's Grandmother passes away, the Trotters gather round to offer their condolences. Ever the considerate friend, Del offers to take some of her valuables off Trig's hands - he wouldn't want just anyone to come along and rip him off, after all. Del spots two urns that might be worth a bob or two, but Rodney and Grandad agree that they must contain the ashes of Trig's Grandfather. As they remember he was an avid bowler, they decide to scatter his ashes on the local bowling green - but to no avail. A second plan to throw his ashes into the Thames is scuppered, and a passing road sweeping lorry eventually sucks them up - a poetic ending when they remember that Trig's Grandad was a road sweeper too.",

Nevertheless, when Boycie challenges him to a winner-takes-all poker game, Del is eager to host it in his flat in Mandela House. As the night progresses, Del's luck goes from bad to worse as he ends up owing Boycie all his money, the TITCO van, Grandad's cash, jewellery and even a collection of loose change. But all is not lost, as Del finally turns the tables on Boycie in revenge for fixing all the previous card games in his favour.",

Not only is Irene a lot older than Rodders, but she's married to a hard nut who's doing time in Parkhurst prison - and is about to be released. Concerned for his brother's welfare, Del convinces Irene to ditch Rodney. But when Rodney realises Del has been interfering with his personal life again, he goes loopy. Soon after, Tommy Mackay gets out of prison - he soon finds out his missus has been cheating on him with a Trotter, and goes looking for revenge. Luckily for Rodney, Tommy finds Del Boy first, and the elder Trotter takes the punishment for him. When a bruised and battered Del returns to the flat, he's over the moon to find out that Rodney has moved onto someone new anyway, so there wasn't really anything to worry about!",

It's also nearing the anniversary of their mother's death, and in an attempt to save a bit of cash, Del and Rodders swipe a bit of spare paint to spruce up her tombstone. While Del leaves Grandad and Rodney to paint the grease-filled Chinese kitchen with 'gold' paint, he heads off to decorate the tombstone. It's only when they've finished painting and get a call from the owner of the Chinese restaurant that they realise the paint was actually luminous yellow. Fine for the walls of a Chinese restaurant kitchen, and it certainly makes a gravestone stand out on a dark night.",

While drowning their sorrows in The Nag's Head, Alex the travel agent mentions that business is slow and he can't give holidays away at the moment. As a promotional gimmick, Del suggests offering an 80% discount on a holiday to the next customer in the shop - and who happens to walk by, but Derek Trotter. Having sold sun-hats in the rain, Rodders has managed to earn some travel cash, but he is dismayed to learn that the 80% discount only extends to a grotty hotel in Benidorm. And despite not being included in the bargain, the brothers reluctantly pay for Grandad to join them on their escape to the sun. During the whole holiday, Del and Rodney check out the local talent, while Grandad cramps their style. Especially when they bring two girls back to their apartment, only for the old man to scare them off with his dentures. Things get a bit more serious when Grandad gets himself arrested. Despite fearing that old history is returning to haunt him - in the form of an incident 'during the war' - it turns out that he was arrested for jay-walking and is released without charge. Much to Del's annoyance.",

    "description": "Despite knocking the price down to a mere six quid, Del Boy can't shift his telescopic Christmas trees (lights, bangles, beads and baubles inclusive). He only has 149 more to sell to make a tidy profit. Stuck for a solution the Trotters decamp to Sid's burger van. Del's conscience seems to get the better of him, and he tells Rodney and Grandad what a shame it is that the market traders can't afford to donate a tree to the local church this year. Especially the little orphans. Left to guard the trees, Rodney steals away to the church. The Vicar quickly debunks Del's story, and Rodders realises the tale was a scam to get an endorsement from The Church of England.",

Del Boy, ever the gentleman, entertains her and sees her home safely. At her flat he discovers that she has a young son, to a husband who seems to have joined a very long queue at the Job Centre 18 months ago and not come back. In no time at all their romance blossoms, and all is running so smoothly Del decides to propose. However, when he takes her for a candle-lit curry, she refuses his offer of marriage. Her husband has returned, employed as a department store Santa, and she wants to give it another go... leaving Del Boy without an angel for Christmas.",

    "description": "Rodney is taking stock of his life, and at the age of 24 he is disappointed to find he has only risen to become Del's look-out while they're on the make with dodgy goods. After a bit of soul-searching - during which Del narrowly escapes the Old Bill while Rodders was lost in thought - Rodney breaks some big news to Del that he's set up a rival business with Mickey Pearce. Shocked and hurt by this, Del warns him that if he wants to stand on his own two feet, then the price is total independence from the TITCO cash flow; including beer money. Later at an auction, Del warns his Little Bruv not to buy Lot 37, but Rodney doubts his brother's generosity - thinking that he wants the lot for himself - and he buys Lot 37 unseen. It turns out that Lot 37 is a bunch of broken lawnmower engines that Del had sold in the first place, and after Mickey Pearce uses their meagre profits for a trip to Benidorm, Rodders is soon back as a partner in Trotters Independent Traders.",

    "description": "The Trotters take a trip down to Cornwall to make use of Boycie's country cottage for a spot of salmon poaching. The fishing trip should be a nice little earner with £10 a salmon being paid for by Mario's fish restaurant. Del thinks that Rodney, Grandad and he will catch the fish and split the profits 50-50 with Boycie for providing the accommodation - they just didn't bank on an escapee from the mental institute. On the rainy journey down to the cottage, a policeman stops their Robin Reliant and warns the tourists that a patient has escaped from the institute for the criminally insane - precisely a decade after he killed a party of weekend fishermen with an axe. Never one to let a psychotic killer get in the way of a nifty bargain, Del ignores the objections of Rodders and Grandad, and they settle down for their first night in the cottage. As the storm worsens, Rodney thinks he hears noises outside, and when a face appears at the window, he's convinced it's the killer. There's a knock at the door, and the Trotters' find the institute's Chief of Security is there to reassure them - it's only later that it becomes clear that he is, in fact, the fugitive axe murderer.",

He unsuccessfully tries to tell her a rickety old cabinet is in fact a 'Queen Anne' original, but wise to the ruse, she coolly declines. Her attitude towards Del does warm when she responds to an advertisement placed by the Trotters in the local paper. When a painting Del has in stock catches her eye, Miranda soon worms her way into Del's affections and in no time at all, he has given her the painting as a gift. Keen to see her again, Del pays a visit to her shop, and is informed that she's at the local auction house. Arriving at the auction, Miranda seems quite surprised to see him there, but not as half as surprised as Del Boy when Lot 24 is announced. The Lot turns out to be Del's painting - a valuable work by 19th century painter Joshua Blythe that Miranda is hoping to make a huge profit on. It seems like Miranda has stung Del good and proper, but as usual, he has the last laugh when he informs her that she's actually selling stolen property.",

    "description": "Del Boy's arch-enemy from school turns up in Peckham, but this time he's known as Detective Inspector Slater from the Met Police. Having known Del and his wily ways since they were at school together, Slater knows exactly who to watch when he's on the trail of some stolen microwaves. Hapless Rodney has no idea who Slater is when he gets chatting to him in The Nags Head. It's only when he sees the horror on Del's face, after bringing Slater back to the flat for a reunion meal, that Rodney realises something is wrong Despite Rodney's best efforts, the game appears to be up - one of the microwaves in question is sitting on the sideboard in full view of everybody. Slater immediately begins to question Del, and after threatening Rodney with fictitious drug charges, he forces Del to turn snitch. Much against his better judgement, Del decides to protect his little brother and spills the beans, but only after bartering for immunity for the whole Trotter family.",

Del hears about the escapade and realises his naïve Little Bruv must have encountered Blossom, a psychologically unhinged woman who is allowed out in public on weekend breaks. Not wanting to prey on Rodney's nervous disposition, Del naturally does the humane thing and concocts a story about the police conducting a search for 'The Peckham Pouncer'. It's not long before Rodney disappears, believing he's a fugitive wanted for the worst of reasons. Regretting what he's done, Del Boy goes in search of his brother, and it's not long before the scent of 'funny fags' from the air vents of Mandela House leads him to Rodney's hiding place - in the water tank room of the same building.",

Having learnt that the Irishman is painting Denzil's flat for £200, Del begins to lie about Brendan's reputation for drunken debauchery, and persuades Denzil that he and Rodney can do the job for a lot cheaper. Unsure about Del's motives, but keen on the saving, Denzil agrees, despite the suspicion on his wife Corrine, who is wise to Del from the very start. The Trotters' begin the job the next day, but problems arise when Rodney leaves a kettle on the boil and steams the whole apartment. As well as forking out for a new kettle, the Trotter's realise that Corrine's pet canary is dead - seemingly killed by the fumes from the paint. Grandad is despatched to find a replacement canary, and having forked out £45 for a substitute bird, he seems to have found the ideal candidate. It's only when Corrine returns home that their scam is revealed - when she left that morning the canary was dead. The Trotters are promptly out on their ears, so they reconvene in The Nags Head, where they drown there sorrows whilst Brendan gloats over them about winning the job back. Little does he know that Del has one last trick left up his sleeve.",

However, several tests later, Reg is given the all clear but it seems Del Boy and Rodders have different blood types. It would seem the wayward father has some explaining to do. Reg explains that he frequently argued with their mother before they split. She had several dalliances with other men, and Del is the mystery child.

While Del and June rekindle their romance, Rodders is dating a lovely girl from the newsagent called Debby - a fact that is seriously curtailing his dirty magazine fetish. It soon transpires that Debby is June's daughter, and it's almost her 19th birthday. Del and Rodney soon put two and two together, and decide that Debby may well be Del's daughter. It gets worse when Rodney realises that he has fallen for a girl who could be his niece. Everything comes to a head when Del finally confronts June to find out whether Debby is his daughter or not. It turns out that Debby was actually fathered by his friend Albie Littlewood, who tragically died in a cycling accident whilst he was seeing June behind Del's back.",

Among the mourners - who have come from as far away as North London - are Del's cousins Jean and Stan, and they're accompanied by Grandad Trotter's brother, Uncle Albert. During the wake at the flat, Rodney seems disturbed by the jovial behaviour and good humour of the mourners. To distract himself he listens to salty old sea dog Albert's stories of his exploits in the Navy. As the wake comes to an end, it appears that Jean and Stan have neglected to take Albert home with them to North London, so Del decides to let him stay the night. The next day it appears that Jean and Stan have gone for good and want nothing to do with Albert. Despite feeling sorry for the old man, Del is reluctant to let him stay and ships Albert off to the Seaman's Mission. It's not long before Albert returns to the flat, as the Seaman's mission has been razed to the ground. So Del reluctantly lets the old boy move in, and a new era begins for the Trotters.",

    "description": "The Trotter's have fallen on hard times, largely due to Rodney's £500 investment in suntan lotion during one of the worst winters ever seen. To make things worse, the deep-fat fryer they sold to Mike, landlord of The Nag's Head, is on the blink and the tension brings Del and Rodney to boiling point. But throughout all this trouble, Uncle Albert, who Rodders blames for their bad luck, keeps telling them that something will turn up. As Albert leaves the pub, he accidentally falls through an open cellar door, and the Trotters' quickly come up with a way to get some cash - by suing the pub for damages. Albert's accident claim finally makes it to court, but to the shock of Del and Rodney, it appears that their Uncle has already sought 15 identical damages claims going back to 1944. Their case gets chucked out of court, and Albert admits he was using some of the tricks he learnt in parachute training to try and help Del and Rodney pay for Grandad's headstone.",

Taking his place as the band's manager, Del winces his way through their rehearsals, and when the Shamrock gig results in a fight, the band are forced to leg it, leaving the instruments behind them. When Rodney finds out the musical equipment has vanished, he contacts the police and helps them with their enquiries. When tell sees Rodney with the constable, he quickly distracts the officer and pulls Rodney aside. It turns out that Del had the instruments on sale or return, and he'd taken them back because their band was so bad. Rodney's dreams of showbiz fame have been shattered, but he goes ballistic when he sees his group performing their old hit single on Top of the Pops and realises that without Del's interference he might have made it to number one.",

Del and Rodney think that the dog may have eaten some reheated pork leftovers for breakfast, and the vet quickly informs them that Duke has probably caught Salmonella. It's only when they get home that they realise Albert has eaten the other half of the pork, and they quickly rush him to hospital. When Albert's gets discharged from hospital a few days later, with a clean bill of health, Del boy discovers that Rodney has been giving Albert's sleeping pills to Duke, and the dog's vitamin supplements to Albert.",

When Rodney admits to Del that he was lying about the girl he's going to bring on Saturday night, his big brother sets about trying to get him a date. On the Friday night, the two brothers head out clubbing, and despite trying almost every club in London, they end up in a seedy little bar in search of a date for Rodney. As luck would have it, Del boy spots Yvonne, an old flame who he knows isn't too picky who she goes out with, and he offers to pay her part of the winnings from Rodney's bet if she'll escort his little bruv the following night. When Rodney gets home from The Nag's Head on Saturday night he's in tears. Apparently, the date went well, until halfway through the evening when Yvonne takes centre stage in the pub and begins her act as a stripper - in front of all of Rodney's mates. Del boy tries to console Rodders with the thought of his £50 winnings, but it turns out the bet was for fifty pence, not pounds.",

Del's supplier, Teddy Cummings, only stocks and supplies in bulk, so it's up to the Trotters to find two grand by the next day or there's no chance of getting the doors. As usual, a solution turns up in the form of Denzil's redundancy money, which they somehow convince him to part with, only to be told by O'Shaughnessy that the doors he's bought aren't needed. And to make things worse, the doors turn out to be stolen. It's not long before Denzil and his five brothers come looking for their money, so with nowhere else to go, the Trotters visit their mother's grave - a favourite refuge for Del in times of trouble. At their mother's graveside, Rodney notices a rare butterfly from the cover of his magazine, that's worth about £3,000 to collectors. After chasing the butterfly around the churchyard, the park and the boating lake, they finally capture it, only for Denzil to wander past and squash it.",

    "description": "Boycie and Abdul pitch a diamond scam to Del Boy, who immediately turns them down. That is until they offer him a £15,000 cut of the estimated £150,000 sale of the stone on the UK market. Del finds himself designated as the courier between Holland and Britain. No sooner has Del enlisted a reluctant Rodders, he hears his old foil Chief Inspector Slater is eyeing Boycie and Abdul as drug dealers. Del decides to hide undetected in the back of Denzil's van. Denzil then getting in and driving them to Hull (pursued by Rodney) was not part of the plan. Thinking quickly, they hire a boat, and let Uncle Albert guide them to Amsterdam. Overcoming counterfeit cash, Albert's amnesia, it's only the arrival of Slater that scuppers them. Despite this, it's Del who has the last laugh.",

Del and Rodney offer to help, and despite Del Boy's dodgy French, they work out that Anna is from Germany, and she's been chucked out on the street and was considering getting her child adopted. They leave Rodney to take Anna to a hotel, but he ends up bringing her back to the flat, where she explains that, Spencer, the son of the family she was working for as an au pair got her pregnant and then denied it all. After fuming about Rodney bringing another 'waif and stray' home, Del Boy considers what can be done with Anna's unwanted baby - and the first person he thinks of is Boycie. For year's Marlene and Boycie have been trying for a child, with no success, and now for a mere three grand, Del is offering them the chance to have their very own baby boy. The stress is clearly getting to Anna, and she begins to go into labour. Later on Del, Boycie and Marlene all gather round in the lounge waiting for Anna and Rodney return from hospital. All is well until Rodney lets Del Boy know that the Anna's baby is a girl... and that Spencer's parents were actually West Indian.",

Whilst chatting with Father O'Keith, Del discovers that the local hospice, St Mary's, requires a £185,000 renovation or it will soon close. And as Derek and Rodney's mother and grandad were both cared for there, the older Trotter takes the charitable cause to his heart. After his confession, Del is about to put some money into the Collection box when Father O'Keith cries out that the statue of the Virgin Mary is weeping holy tears. Within a couple of seconds, Del has persuaded the priest that this miracle needs publicising - something that could go a long way towards raising funds for St Mary's renovations. Father O'Keith reluctantly agrees, and Del gets Rodney to alert the national press. As press arrives from all over the world, Del helps Father O'Keith collect the contributions from all those who wish to witness the miracle of the weeping virgin. It's only when the priest notices rain dripping from the roof of the church that Del Boy's elaborate hoax is exposed.",

And things get worse when they're taken to the manager's office and realise that they've lost their receipt for the goods. Shortly after, Tom the security guard brings a cocky shoplifter, Lennox Gilbey, into the manager's office, where he promptly pulls out a gun and demands money from the safe. Unluckily for Lennox the safe is on a time-lock and due to the dodgy watch he's wearing, he's 15 minutes later than he planned - and the safe doesn't open until 8am the next morning. After being held hostage throughout the night, Del realises that he sold the dodgy watch to Lennox, and that he also knew him as a kid. By preying on his guilty conscience, Del persuades Lennox to reveal that the plan was hatched by Tom and the supermarket manager to get at the £60,000 stored in the safe. The three accomplices beg Del not to go to the police, and instead, he arranges for Lennox to get a job as security guard at the supermarket after Tom's retirement, and then makes sure he wins a £1,000 prize as the millionth customer in the store.",

Despite almost coming to blows, Del and Rodney manage to invite Lisa round to the flat for tea, and she seems more than happy to accept. In preparation for their date with Lisa, Del goes out to get some more 'Smash' and Rodney spends half-an-hour on the sunbed. Just before Del leaves for the shops, he notices Rodney has dozed off and whacks up the heat on the bed. Much to Rodney's annoyance, he spends most of the evening nursing his bright red face, which has burnt under the ultra-violet rays, whilst Del and Lisa seem to be getting on really well. To get his revenge, Rodders picks up on the fact that Lisa mentions she was going hang-gliding, and as a surprise for his 46th birthday, he arranges for Del to have a go. After offering to give her a left back home to Winchester, Del and Rodney head off to meet Lisa's friends for a spot of hang-gliding. Not wanting to loose face, Del reluctantly agrees to try it out, and after launching himself into the air, he disappears for over 12 hours.",

    "description": "Rodney's Art Class is given a £10,000 grant to make a film spotlighting the local community, but first he has to avoid the scheming intentions of Mickey Pearce and Del Boy. Whilst Rodders suffers from writer's block, Del provides him with inspiration and a tale of a killer Rhino escaping from London Zoo and laying waste to innocent victims on the streets of the city. Rodney immediately points out the flaws in the logic behind the plot, and Del leaves him to it. But without telling Rodney, Del has already arranged for Mickey to head down to the town hall to film different couples' weddings at £50 a time - and he has also managed to persuade half the neighbourhood to pay £10 for the opportunity of becoming an movie extra. To make things worse, Mickey arranges for the lovely Amanda to pop round the Trotters' flat in her nurse's uniform and begin filming a 'blue movie' called Night Nurse, which is due for its premiere in the back room of The Nag's Head.",

Trigger surprises everyone by inviting a date he met through an agency. This arouses Del's curiosity and soon he too has a date from the match-making company. Rodney takes the initiative by going for the 'James Dean' look, though this ends in disaster due to an encounter with some punks. Things look rosy for Del though. His date with Raquel Turner (unemployed actress) goes swimmingly... until it turns out she is works as a strippergram twice a week. Despite a small run in with the police, love conquers all in the end.",

However he will ensure that he gets double the price to satisfy Del and his friends. As he is selling the chains to the other customer,Mr. Stavros, he collapses with a heart attack and is taken away,along with the money and the chains, by two ambulance men. However,it is a con. They are not real ambulance drivers but Arnie's sons,helping him relieve punters of their money. But then Cassandra hears that Arnie is going to sell the chains to Denzil. Cue Del and Co. to pose as ambulance men and wait for Arnie's next 'heart attack.'",

    "description": "The Trotters join other Nag's Head regulars on a day trip to Margate. However, possibly due to one of the Albanian radios Del has imported and is fitted in the coach there is a fire and an explosion and, due to a train strike, the party are forced to stay overnight. As it is a Bank Holiday accommodation is scarce and the Trotters find themselves in a creepy old guest house run by scary Mrs. Cresswell. Del and Rodney go to a club where they see magician the Great Ramondo and his assistant, Raquel, a former girl-friend of Del. Returning to the guest house they find themselves locked out and return to Raquel's flat, where Del, who still has feelings for her, makes a fool of himself by assuming that Ramondo, who is actually gay, is sexually harassing her and hits him, throwing his suit-case out of a window. On return to London Rodney makes a similar fool of himself by assuming that Cassandra is having an affair with her boss, whilst Del finds out that the suit-case he threw out of the window hit Boycie and Trigger.",

Cassandra leaves Rodney, claiming that he lacks drive. He turns vegetarian and sports a clip-on pony-tail to appear trendy but when Cassandra gets back in touch with him she tells him she prefers him just as he is. Raquel gives birth to a baby boy, which Rodney has jokingly suggested be called Damien, a name Del and Raquel are happy to give him.

The Occhettis welcome the brothers but they have a plan. Occhetti is to stand trial for several crimes. If Del is found dead and it is assumed that he is the Mafioso, the don will be in a position to start a new life. Several unsuccessful attempts to kill Del follow, as does an argument between Rodney and Occhetti, whom Rodney believes to be his brother. When Del and Rodney tumble to what is happening they go on the run but are saved by Marlene and Boycie, who are on holiday in Miami. They also supply evidence of the Occhettis' drug-dealing. Back home in Peckham Del finds the crates of wine stacked up in his flat but the television news tells him that, thanks to his efforts, Occhetti has been imprisoned.",

He also finds a tap, hidden by rocks, but claims that there is an actual spring, yielding 'Peckham Spring Water'. Using a bottle of mineral water for the lab test he gets the water accepted and sold to a supermarket chain. Unfortunately he is unaware that it has been contaminated by the same yellow liquid he chucked in the reservoir and, as he turns out the light, the water starts to glow green.",

However the Reliant Robin breaks down and, as the brothers are running through the fog in costume, they scare off a gang of muggers about to rob a female councillor. At the party they are the only guests in costume because the birthday boy has actually died and the party is now a wake. But there is good news next day when Del catches one of the muggers as he is about to rob an old lady and knocks him unconscious. He gets a medal AND his council grant as a reward for helping the female councillor. Good news for Rodney too as Cassandra announces that she is pregnant.",

Whilst Rodney and Cassandra spice up their love life by dressing up, Del decides to restore the family wealth by going on the quiz show 'Gold Rush', hosted by Jonathan Ross.

Back home Del gets a call from the show to say that Rodney's answer was actually correct so that Del has won the prize money after all. Unfortunately Del thinks it's pub regular Mickey playing a trick on him and tells Ross to give the \"winnings\" to charity...",

Back in Peckham they discover a young man who seems to have stowed away in their van and can only answer \"Gary\" to everything asked of him. In fact he is called Rashid and he was loading the van when he got trapped behind the booze. He was carried to England against his wishes and Del and company get charged with kidnapping him.",
