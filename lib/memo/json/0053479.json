It seems that the Carters and Wakefields have been feuding for years and the patriarchs ain't about to let one o' theirs marry one o' them, so Andy backs down. In the morning Andy decides the best course of action is to end the feud before marrying the couple and visits both fathers. He learns that neither knows how the feud started and that no one has been killed in the 87 years of fighting. Andy proposes a duel to end the feud but both men run off rather than take the chance of getting killed. In the end, Andy marries Josh and Hannah at gunpoint.",

When the town council appoints Andy and Barney to sell an old cannon, they have no luck until an antique dealer comes through town. He is hesitant at first, but Andy makes up a history for the old gun and the man agrees to buy it for $175. When Opie follows Andy's example and trades a broken cuff link as a button off General George Washington's uniform for a pair of roller skates and money, Andy realizes he broke the golden rule himself and tries to make amends. The dealer still wants the cannon so Andy cuts the price to $20.",

Since nothing else has worked, Andy tries a little experiment - he makes them come in every morning for fifteen minutes to sit and speak politely to one another - which seems to work. At home, he tells Opie and Billy they will earn five cents each for playing nice after he catches them fighting. Well, the Boones learn to be polite to each other but start snapping at everyone else. Fred assaults his card-playing buddies and Jenny almost takes Aunt Bee's head off over an innocent remark. Billy stops coming over to play because it's no fun anymore. Andy realizes that \"what looks like 'rasslin' to one is dancin' to another\" and calls off the experiment after ten days.",

As they are drinking sodas, Barney starts worrying Andy about Ellie and the doctor becoming attracted to one other. After Bee scolds him and Opie says he's scared, Andy finally calls on Ellie one evening and asks...well, orders her to the social with him.

    "description": "When a farmer's daughter won't buy cosmetics for herself because her father wouldn't approve, Ellie decides to give the girl a few of the items, contrary to Andy's warning about meddling. Andy and Ellie go to Flint's place to deliver the items, but he refuses to let Frankie keep them and offers no explanation. Barney talks to Flint, to no avail, then takes Frankie into custody and delivers her to Ellie at home. When Frances returns, her father doesn't even recognize her at first, and, although he thinks she's \"right pretty\", he still needs her to help work the farm because he has no sons like Jenkins, his neighbor, whose sons are working just beyond the fence. There's disappointment all around until Andy tries an experiment to show Flint what the most efficient use of his one asset, his daughter, might be.",

Andy and Barney come up with the money themselves, but Ben refuses it, saying he is now owed the entire balance, and threatens Andy if he doesn't serve the paper. Barney starts the \"Save the Scobey House Fund\" while Andy finds legal ways to stall the process. Andy takes Lester's eyeglasses so he can't read the notice and they even hold a rummage sale, at which Ben gives Andy an ultimatum, and he decides to show Ben how mean he really is. At noon the next day, Andy, with Ben in tow, ruthlessly confronts the Scobey's and practically forces them out the door. The bewildered couple tries to move out in an orderly way but Andy will have none of it and reduces Mrs. Scobey to tears. It's even too much for Ben, who calls off the foreclosure, and Andy returns Lester's eyeglasses with a wink and a smile.",

Back in the courthouse, with the storm raging and Barney on patrol, Andy gets a call from Sam to come to his place.

    "description": "The town gives a big \"Welcome Home\" to Jim Lindsey, a local boy who became \"prosperous and famous\" playing guitar with Bobby Fleet's band. He's out on his own now and bragging about all the offers he's getting. Andy becomes suspicious, though, when he finds out Jim is not paying any of his bills and borrowing money, and when he finds out Jim's not getting any mail either he asks Bobby Fleet to come to town. Bobby tells him the whole story and is ready to take Jim back. Andy catches Jim as he's about to leave town and has to arrest him to get him to see Bobby, who pays his debts and offers him a raise to rejoin the band. Jim agrees and they shake on it.",

Bee gives Opie the job of planting \"spinish\" but his heart's just not in it. He misses his father, and Andy misses him just as much. Tired of watering his garden, Opie walks to the courthouse but Andy sends him home where he wanders off again, this time kicking a can, which takes him first to the old Johnson mine, which caves in while he's trying to enter, then to a house where he trades the can for apples. He eats his fill and promptly falls asleep in the back of a pickup truck and winds up in Elm City after dark. In the meantime, Bee has noticed his absence and called Andy, who starts searching. After a call, Andy retrieves Opie and after he tells Aunt Bee of his adventures she decides that he needs to see more of his father at the courthouse.",

Charlene is already married to Dud Wash but Ernest T doesn't recognize the marriage because it wasn't performed by a preacher. Reluctantly, Andy agrees to help out and he and Barney make the long drive up to the mountains the next day. Ernest T is not impressed by the lawmen and continues breaking windows. Andy decides the best solution is another wedding, this time with the circuit preacher presiding. When Ernest T threatens to kidnap the bride Andy dresses Barney up as a decoy and Dud and Charlene are remarried while Ernest T is trying to figure out who Barney is. In the end Dud and Ernest T shake hands and they all celebrate at the cabin.",

Soon, Andy is just as stressed and he tells Opie to buckle down and cut out the play time.

Andy can't understand since he's been quite strict with the boy who has done nothing but study. Helen suggest that that may just be the problem.",

They listen in on conversations and the like but Tommy has a sense of humor that not everyone appreciates. When Goober adopts a stray dog, they hide one of the walkie-talkies in the animal's collar and soon the gullible mechanic thinks he has a talking dog. Goober soon makes a fool of himself and the boys think it's quite funny. Andy tries to impress upon them that humiliating people is not funny and teaches Tommy a lesson in what it feels like to be the butt of someone's practical joke.",

She also assures Andy that the baby will be no trouble at all. She's somewhat taken aback however when the baby cries every time she picks her up. Others seem to have no problem, including Andy. She soon finds herself asking anyone who is handy to stop by the house at feeding times, as she's convinced herself that the baby hates her. An emergency of sorts convinces her otherwise.",

With Andy and Emmett acting as co-signers, he borrows the money and is soon the proud owner of his own business. His idea of being a business executive may be a bit off kilter however. His first act is to hire an employee to do the manual work while he does all of the 'thinking'. Only problem is, he's not much of businessman and Andy and Emmett start to wonder what they have got themselves into when Goober starts to make some pretty serious errors, like forgetting to order gas. When Goober reads about a well-educated man who lost millions when he became head of his company, he loses all confidence in himself.",

    "description": "Goober finds out Andy is taking Aunt Bee and Opie to the auto show in Raleigh and asks to go along, confident they'll get free samples when salesmen find out he's a \"big operator\". At the hotel, Goober calls up Roy Swanson, an old friend from trade school, to see how he's doing and to brag a little. They meet at the show and Goober is surprised to find out that Roy is a senior vice-president in charge of engineering with Amalgamated Motors. After hearing about a fellow student, Goober tells Roy he has a chain of stations instead of just one. When Roy meets the Taylors and invites them to dinner, Goober says it's his treat and chooses the finest restaurant in Raleigh. At dinner, Goober, out of his element, tries to act like a big shot but things don't work out and Roy finds out the truth. As they prepare to go home the next day, Andy unsuccessfully tries to cheer up a dejected Goober, who feels like a complete failure. Stopping for gas, Andy gets a bottle of pop and sees Roy, covered in grease, working on a car. He calls Goober over and asks him if he'd like to say hello to an old friend but Goober declines, saying he wouldn't want to embarrass him.",

They focus on Mayberry and soon Goober is filling out the questionnaire. Opie tries to tell him that he's not answering the questionnaire correctly - such as saying he read 30 books a month when in fact he reads that many comic books - but Goober perseveres. Soon, he's on a date with the highly educated designer of the questionnaire and it becomes painfully apparent that they have little in common. As things develop however, she soon finds there may be some advantage to the lifestyle and attraction of small-town living.",
