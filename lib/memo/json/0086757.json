His mother-in-law Nell is critical of his womanizing after he returns from a business trip to Monte Carlo with the leggy Christine and tells him he should consider re-marrying for Samantha's sake. Whilst not going quite that far Simon does turn down a further evening with Christine to be home in time to sample the sausage rolls his daughter has made him.",

Though efficient Winifred is no ray of sunshine and then Liz returns - her acting career cut short when the director got fresh with her. Simon cannot fairly sack Winifred so he plots to get her back with her husband, a double glazing salesman, on the premise that he needs new windows. The plan works and Winifred returns to her spouse, who has hit Simon with a big double glazing bill.",
