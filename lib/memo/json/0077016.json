Two men get on the train - Oaksey,known to Fletch,and the more military type,Tanner. Oaksey gives Fletch a bag to mind,which actually contains stolen jewels. The two men are arrested but MacKay inadvertently saves Fletch when the police board the train to question them by claiming that the bag is his.",
