    "description": "Sharron MacReady, Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett work as agents for international law enforcement bureau Nemesis, based in Geneva, Whilst returning from a mission in China with bacteriological material stolen from the Chinese, their plane is shot down over the Himalayas. They survive and are nurtured by a Tibetan tribe, presided over by an elderly lama, who give them super-human strength, telepathic powers and augmented hearing. This allows them to best their pursuers and return to Geneva, though they keep their promise to the old lama not to divulge to their boss Tremayne - or anybody - how they have obtained their new strengths.",

They are however captured by a crazed Latin American dictator,Gomez, who is behind the nuclear explosions and who aims to hold the major governments to ransom with threats of nuclear detonation. He locks the lads in a deep freeze room but they are able to tele-communicate with Sharron back at Nemesis headquarters by transferring their feelings of extreme cold to her.She tells Tremayne to send a message to the main Scott Base but he is reluctant and it looks as if it is down to her to save her colleagues from an icy death.",

The popular view is that treasure stolen by the Nazis is hidden in the lake but local official Franz Reitz dismisses this. Craig and Richard are shot at as they prepare to investigate the lake, but later find a map leading them to a disused iron mine, which they enter. They meet an old man who tells them that Nazis who wished to continue the war hid a cache of weapons in the mine, but then all three are trapped by an explosion, causing a rockfall. Sharron overcomes Reitz and uses her powers to shift the rocks and joins her colleagues and the old man in the mine. They are confronted by Reitz's twin brother, a deranged colonel and sole survivor of the Nazi troop who wished to continue fighting the war. Another explosion traps the Champions in the tunnel and yet again they must bring their powers into play in order to escape.",

A plane flying over the same island is shot down and so the agents of Nemesis investigate. Sharron and Craig pose as ship-wreck survivors and are taken prisoner by the island overlord Max Kellor and his band of Chinese warriors. Richard meanwhile lands by parachute and discovers a slave army working at a rocket site. The missile is pointed towards America and the plan is to make the Americans think the Russians have fired it. Richard is also captured and must pretend that he does not recognize the other Champions if they are to escape and save the world again.",

Richard infiltrates the group by posing as a known killer called Burke but when Burke escapes from prison the other two Champions race to join Richard at the group's headquarters and aid him in the confrontation. The name of the next intended victim is contained in a securely-locked safe but Sharron manages to use her powers to reveal that the target is actually Tremayne. They may not always agree with him but the Champions rally to save their boss from being rubbed out.",

To activate the devices a nuclear physicist is required and, when Dr. Mueller goes missing, it seems likely that he has been kidnapped for that purpose. The Champions manage to locate him and, posing as his associates, board the submarine with him. Alas, he too is a Nazi sympathiser and part of the plan, who gives the Champions away.

When Richard wakes up he is in London, in a beautiful apartment but with iron bars over the windows. For company there is a young woman called Samantha.Richard meets his abductor who tells him that, unless he can crack a code for him in twelve hours, Samantha will be killed. Mercifully for Richard, Craig has side-stepped the red herrings designed to put him off the trail, and is on his way to rescue his colleague.",

Sharron is sent to his hotel the Kimberley, which is playing host to a gathering of international worthies, some of whom seem superstitiously alarmed by Dumballa, a local practitioner of voodoo, who performs a cabaret act called the Shadow of the Panther. Sharron teams up with journalist David Crayley, who tells her that the bigwigs seem to tell him anything he asks as if they were in a trance, but later he too appears to have succumbed to the voodoo when he fails to recognize Sharron. By the time Craig and Richard arrive on the island, Sharron also appears to be in a very zombic state. How can they get her and the others ,back to normal and defeat the exponents of the voodoo?",

Sharron gains his confidence when she tells him she is being followed by a man, who is Craig. Craig confronts Del Marco, claiming he is out for revenge against him following the murder of his brother. Craig is seen off the premises and one of Del Marco's henchmen shakes his hand. He is wearing a glove soaked in a poison which will induce a desire to commit suicide by the recipient of the handshake and Craig climbs to the top of a high building to throw himself off. Richard and Sharron have to communicate with him to avert disaster.",

He is one of several scientists who have disappeared after going to work on something called Project Zero, allegedly under government auspices but actually a rogue project headed by one Dr. Voss. Richard infiltrates the group by posing as a computer expert and travels to their Scottish base, followed by Sharron and Craig,but his cover is blown and a collar of explosives put around his neck. He is rescued by the other Champions, who discover that the Project is making a fission gun, which will detonate nuclear warheads. The Champions lead the captive scientists in an attack on the control room but Voss and his staff escape in a plane and use the fission gun to fire on the Champions.",

The best hope of stability is to restore the Bey, in exile in Rome,but he is reluctant to leave his playboy life-style and Sharron knocks him out so that she and Craig can fly him into El Hari. A wireless operator at the landing stage warns the Bey's enemies of his arrival, and the journey is continued in a truck across the desert. The Bey is shot by a sniper and tribesmen host the trio but when the Bey learns that Said, his supposed aide, has paid them to kill him, he resolves to resume his rule. The travellers still have to reach the capital, however, and face another attempt on the Bey's life.",

He is gassed before he can leave and captured by Major Duncan, head of M7. Duncan calls in the Champions to see if they can steal the file, proving the need for a better security system. Mauncey does not know why he entered the vault and he is then killed. Richard enters the vault but memorizes the file's contents before escaping, though he is pursued by heavies, who take him to the man who wants the file. Craig traces a link between Duncan and Mauncey having the same dentist, after Mauncey is hypnotised, as Dauncey was, by the dentist.

Some time afterwards, he dies, presumably of poison. His widow tells the Champions that just before he disappeared, his brief-case went missing. Tremayne also tries to kill a doctor and he too has had his brief-case taken. Richard acts as decoy by having his wallet stolen. He is taken to a police station by a bogus officer where he learns, first hand, that both George and Tremayne were drugged with a mind-altering substance that turned them into assassins. Now he is programmed . . .to kill Craig. Craig must find the antidote to the drug before it is too late.",
