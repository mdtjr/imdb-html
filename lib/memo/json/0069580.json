It's suggested that the couple try and work things out, so they head to their cabin by the lake. While boating, she falls overboard and, after initially trying to save her, Arthur decides he'd be happier if she drowns. He pulls the ring from her finger just as she's going down for the last time; it's this very same ring he intends to give to his secretary.",
